 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">What is the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients hospitalized for a first episode of syncope?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Pulmonary embolism was identified in nearly one out of every six patients hospitalized for a first episode of syncope.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not emphasize deep exploration for pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients presenting with syncope. However, this study found that PE is relatively common in hospitalized patients following a syncope event. There was a high prevalence of approximately 17.3%.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Since this study, guidelines may pay more attention to evaluating for PE in patients who present with syncope.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Cross-sectional study conducted across 11 hospitals in Italy, examining patients older than 18 hospitalized for a first episode of syncope.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In total, 560 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 76 years.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
Patients older than 18 years, hospitalized for a first episode of syncope, with syncope defined as transient loss of consciousness with rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous resolution.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
Patients with previous episodes of syncope, those on anticoagulation therapy, or who were pregnant.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
Elderly population with over 75% of participants aged 70 or older. Most patients had clinical evidence suggesting an explanation for syncope other than PE.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients had a systematic workup for PE based on the 2014 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology using a combination of Wells score and d-dimer assay results. Further assessment included computed tomography or ventilation-perfusion lung scanning when indicated.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
The primary outcome was the prevalence of pulmonary embolism diagnosed by imaging or autopsy in patients admitted to the hospital following an episode of syncope.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by institutional research funding from the University of Padua.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The original publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, 2016, and the accompanying editorial and supplementary material may provide further insights into the study details and its implications for clinical practice. </span></p>
