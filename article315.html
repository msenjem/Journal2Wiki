 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Arthroscopic lavage and débridement did not result in improved pain or function when compared with placebo surgery for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Arthroscopic surgery is a common intervention for knee osteoarthritis, yet its efficacy compared to placebo had not been rigorously evaluated. This randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 180 patients found no difference in pain relief or improved function between those who underwent arthroscopic lavage or débridement and those who received placebo surgery over a 24-month period.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current clinical practice guidelines have moved away from recommending arthroscopic interventions like lavage and débridement for knee osteoarthritis, focusing instead on non-surgical approaches such as physical therapy, weight loss, and pain management.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
- N=180 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee
- Interventions: arthroscopic débridement, arthroscopic lavage, or placebo surgery
- Follow-up period: 24 months
- Primary outcomes: self-reported knee pain severity and functional assessment; objective test of walking and stair climbing.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion criteria: Patients ≤75 years with osteoarthritis of the knee, experiencing moderate to severe knee pain despite 6 months of medical treatment, and no arthroscopy in the previous 2 years.
- Exclusion criteria: Severe osteoarthritis (grade ≥9), severe deformity, and serious medical problems.
- 165 patients completed the trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Arthroscopic débridement: involved joint lavage with 10 liters of fluid, removal of loose debris, trimming of torn meniscal fragments, and smoothing of meniscus and articular cartilage.
- Arthroscopic lavage: 10 liters of fluid lavage without mechanical débridement or tissue removal, except in cases of mechanically unstable meniscal tears.
- Placebo surgery: simulated arthroscopic procedure without arthroscopic insertion or tissue removal.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: Knee pain at 24 months using the Knee-Specific Pain Scale (KSPS)
- Secondary: Additional assessments of pain and function including scales from the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS2-P and AIMS2-WB) and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36-P and SF-36-PF), as well as an objective Physical Functioning Scale (PFS).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Study participants were mostly men, as trials were conducted at a Veterans Affairs medical center, potentially limiting generalizability.
- High refusal rate of eligible patients, possibly due to knowing the one-in-three chance of undergoing a placebo procedure, may have introduced selection bias.
- All procedures performed by a single surgeon, though highly skilled, could affect the applicability of the results to other surgeons' practices.
