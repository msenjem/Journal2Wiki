 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A strategy of omitting prophylactic platelet transfusions was inferior to the standard practice of prophylactic transfusions in preventing bleeding events of WHO grade 2, 3, or 4 in patients with hematologic cancers and thrombocytopenia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prophylactic platelet transfusions are commonly administered to prevent bleeding in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. The effectiveness of this practice for patients with hematologic cancers has been questioned, spurring researchers to investigate potential changes in the standard of care. The Trial of Prophylactic Platelets (TOPPS), conducted across the UK and Australia, tested whether withholding prophylactic platelet transfusions in thrombocytopenic patients with hematologic cancers would be as effective and safe in preventing bleeding events as the standard practice of providing prophylactic transfusions.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">The open-label, noninferiority randomized trial involved 600 patients who were assigned either to a no-prophylaxis policy or to receive standard prophylactic platelet transfusions when platelet counts were less than 10×10^9 per liter. The primary outcome was the occurrence of WHO grade 2 or higher bleeding events up to 30 days after randomization.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">The trial found that 50% of patients in the no-prophylaxis group experienced grade 2, 3, or 4 bleeding events, compared to 43% in the prophylaxis group, demonstrating the superiority of prophylactic platelet transfusions in reducing bleeding events. Platelet use was markedly reduced in the no-prophylaxis group, although patients also experienced more days with bleeding. Subgroup analysis showed similar rates of bleeding among patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation, irrespective of prophylaxis policy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend prophylactic platelet transfusions for patients with hematologic cancers, especially for those undergoing chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomized, noninferiority trial conducted at 14 centers in the UK and Australia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Patients ≥16 years of age with hematologic cancers undergoing chemotherapy or stem-cell transplantation, with existing or expected thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50×10^9 per liter).
- Exclusion Criteria: Previous WHO grade 3 or 4 bleeding events, WHO grade 2 bleeding during current admission, inherited hemostatic or thrombotic disorders, need for therapeutic anticoagulants, acute promyelocytic leukemia, known HLA antibodies, prior study participation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- No Prophylaxis Group: Did not receive prophylactic platelet transfusions unless platelet counts were less than 10×10^9 per liter.
- Prophylaxis Group: Received standard prophylactic platelet transfusions when platelet count was less than 10×10^9 per liter.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Percentage of patients with bleeding events of WHO grade 2, 3, or 4 up to 30 days post-randomization.
- Secondary Outcomes: Days with WHO grade 2, 3, or 4 bleeding; time to first grade 2, 3, or 4 bleeding episode; number of platelet and red-cell transfusions; days with platelet count less than 20×10^9 per liter; time until recovery from thrombocytopenia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The primary bleeding assessment relies on patient and staff reporting, which could introduce variance between study centers.
- The trial was not powered to specifically determine whether withholding prophylactic transfusions in patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation is safe and effective.
