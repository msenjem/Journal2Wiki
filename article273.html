 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with newly diagnosed ANCA-associated vasculitis and renal involvement, is rituximab-based regimen superior to standard intravenous cyclophosphamide for inducing sustained remission?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A rituximab-based regimen was not found to be superior to standard intravenous cyclophosphamide treatment in inducing sustained remission for ANCA-associated vasculitis, maintaining high remission rates in both groups without reducing early severe adverse events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The RITUXVAS trial did not demonstrate the superiority of rituximab over cyclophosphamide in inducing sustained remission in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, with both regimens showing similarly high remission rates. Treatment with rituximab also did not lead to a reduction in early severe adverse events, although it allows for reduced exposure to cyclophosphamide and avoidance of maintenance immunosuppression.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of August 2021, no guidelines reflecting the results of this trial have been described.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Open-label, parallel-group, randomized trial
N=44 patients with newly diagnosed ANCA-associated vasculitis and renal involvement
Rituximab group (n=33)
Control group (standard intravenous cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine) (n=11)
Setting: 8 centers in Europe and Australia
Enrollment: June 2006 to June 2007
Mean follow-up: 12 months
Primary endpoints: Sustained remission rates at 12 months, severe adverse events
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
New diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis
ANCA positivity
Renal involvement with necrotizing glomerulonephritis on biopsy or red-cell casts/hematuria on urinalysis
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
Not described
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
Median age: 68 years
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR): 18 ml per minute per 1.73 m²
Use of plasma exchange balanced between groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Rituximab group: Intravenous rituximab at 375 mg/m² for 4 weeks with two intravenous cyclophosphamide pulses, without azathioprine
Control group: Intravenous cyclophosphamide for 3-6 months followed by azathioprine
Both groups received standard glucocorticoid regimen
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
Sustained remission
Rituximab group: 76%
Control group: 82% (P=0.68)
Severe adverse events
Rituximab group: 42%
Control group: 36% (P=0.77)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Time to remission: Similar between groups
Change in GFR: Median increase, rituximab group = 19 ml/min; control group = 15 ml/min (P=0.14)
Prednisolone dose: Similar reduction in both groups
Quality of life (SF-36): Improvement in both groups, but rituximab group showed a significant improvement in the mental component (P=0.04), with two outliers influencing results
Vasculitis Damage Index: Changes similar between groups
Relapse: 15% in rituximab group, 10% in control group (P=0.70)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial did not determine long-term efficacy and safety beyond 12 months, and long-term benefits of rituximab remain uncertain.
The trial's relatively small sample size and open-label design could potentially introduce bias.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by Cambridge University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust, F. Hoffmann–La Roche with provision of rituximab, and a research grant contributing to trial costs.
