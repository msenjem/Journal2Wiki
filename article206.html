 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Treatment with prednisolone significantly improves short-term survival in patients with severe biopsy-proved alcoholic hepatitis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis has been inconsistent in controlled trials. This study aimed to re-evaluate the hypothesis that corticosteroids could improve short-term survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, identified by discriminant-function value or spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last knowledge update, specific guidelines reflecting the results of this trial concerning the management of severe alcoholic hepatitis with corticosteroids could not be provided.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
- N=61 patients with biopsy-proved alcoholic hepatitis
- Prednisolone (40 mg per day) vs placebo
- Setting: Two medical centers
- Enrollment: March 1987 to June 1990
- Primary endpoint: Death within two months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Long-standing history of alcoholism
- Clinical features of alcoholic hepatitis
- Biopsy-proved alcoholic hepatitis
- Spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy or discriminant-function value higher than 32
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Gastrointestinal bleeding or bacterial infection not controlled within 48 hours
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- 57 patients had evidence of cirrhosis on biopsy
- 4 patients had alcoholic hepatitis and fibrosis
- Mean follow-up: Not specified
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomized to either prednisolone 40 mg or placebo, given as a single morning dose for 28 days
- Patients unable to take oral medication received prednisolone or placebo intravenously
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- At day 66 post-randomization, survival was 88±5 percent in the prednisolone group vs 45±8 percent in the placebo group (log-rank test, 10.9; P=0.001)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- At six months post-enrollment, cumulative survival rates were 84±6 percent for prednisolone vs 45±9 percent for placebo (log-rank test, 9.5; P=0.002)
- No major adverse effects related to corticosteroid therapy were observed
