 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Treatment with drotrecogin alfa (activated) significantly reduces mortality in patients with severe sepsis but may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Severe sepsis, a generalized inflammatory and procoagulant response to infection, results in a high rate of mortality despite advancements in critical care. Drotrecogin alfa (activated), or recombinant human activated protein C, has antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, and profibrinolytic properties. This phase 3 trial assessed its efficacy in reducing mortality rates in patients with severe sepsis.
