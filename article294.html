 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with acute non-severe ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack, is ticagrelor superior to aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, ticagrelor is not superior to aspirin in reducing the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Ticagrelor, a potent P2Y12 receptor antagonist acting on platelets, was investigated as a potential alternative to aspirin as initial therapy after an acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack. The SOCRATES trial found that ticagrelor did not significantly reduce the rate of subsequent stroke, myocardial infarction, or death compared to aspirin.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, guidelines have not been established that reflect the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial
- N=13,199
- Ticagrelor: n=6,589 (180 mg loading dose, then 90 mg twice daily days 2-90)
- Aspirin: n=6,610 (300 mg on day 1, then 100 mg daily days 2-90)
- Setting: 674 centers in 33 countries
- Enrollment: January 7, 2014 to October 29, 2015
- Mean follow-up: 90 days
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion criteria: Nonsevere ischemic stroke (NIHSS score ≤5) or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score ≥4 or symptomatic arterial stenosis), ability to start treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset, age ≥40 years, CT or MRI exclusion of intracranial bleeding
- Exclusion criteria: Need for specific antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, planned revascularization within 7 days, history of atrial fibrillation or suspicion of cardioembolic cause, thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy within 24 hours before randomization, severe liver disease, renal failure requiring dialysis, pregnancy, or lactation, among others.
- Baseline characteristics: Median age 65 years, 66.7% male
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Ticagrelor: 180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2 through 90
- Aspirin: 300 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2 through 90
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcome occurrence: Ticagrelor, 6.7% (442 patients); Aspirin, 7.5% (497 patients); hazard ratio 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.01; P=0.07.
- Ischemic stroke occurrence: Ticagrelor, 5.8% (385 patients); Aspirin, 6.7% (441 patients); hazard ratio 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00; nominal P=0.046.
- Safety outcomes: Major bleeding in 0.5% Ticagrelor and 0.6% Aspirin, intracranial hemorrhage in 0.2% Ticagrelor and 0.3% Aspirin, fatal bleeding in 0.1% for both groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- No ticagrelor benefit in a significant proportion of patients already on aspirin at the time of the qualifying event.
- Subgroup analysis did not show a significant benefit of ticagrelor over aspirin.
- Exclusion of patients with a high risk of stroke such as those with carotid or severe intracranial stenosis.
- Thrombolytic therapy patients were excluded, thus not generalizable to this population.
