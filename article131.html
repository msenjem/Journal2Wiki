 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">The long-term use of left ventricular assist devices in select patients with end-stage heart failure ineligible for cardiac transplantation significantly improved survival and quality of life compared to optimal medical management, despite the occurrence of serious adverse events, including infection and device malfunction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Optimal medical management of end-stage heart failure has limited efficacy in improving survival and quality of life. The only substantial individual benefits have been seen in cardiac transplantation, but donor organ availability is limited. The Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial provided evidence that left ventricular assist devices offer an alternative long-term myocardial replacement therapy option for end-stage heart failure patients not eligible for transplant.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">As of the last knowledge cutoff, specific guidelines based on this REMATCH trial were not detailed. However, general heart failure management guidelines might now include a consideration for left ventricular assist devices as an alternative therapy option for specific groups of patients with contraindications to transplantation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized controlled trial.
- N=129 patients with end-stage heart failure ineligible for cardiac transplantation.
- Intervention group: left ventricular assist device (n=68).
- Control group: optimal medical management (n=61).
- Stratification according to center.
- Primary outcome: all-cause mortality.
- Mean follow-up: until 92 deaths occurred (approx. 18 months for the trial).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Chronic end-stage heart failure.
- NYHA class IV symptoms for at least 60-90 days despite medical therapy.
- Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤25%.
- Peak oxygen consumption ≤12-14 ml/kg/min, or dependent on IV inotropic therapy or intraaortic balloon pump.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Eligibility for cardiac transplantation.
- Life expectancy limited by noncardiac conditions.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Mean patient age ranged from 18 to over 70 years.
- Most common reason for ineligibility for transplantation: age over 65 years.
- Other comorbidities: insulin-dependent diabetes with end-organ damage, chronic renal failure, or other significant conditions.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Device group: implantation of a vented electric left ventricular assist device.
- Medical-therapy group: optimal medical management according to contemporary heart failure treatment guidelines.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Risk of death from any cause: 48% risk reduction with the left ventricular assist device (P=0.001).
- Kaplan–Meier survival estimates at one year: 52% in the device group vs. 25% in the medical-therapy group (P=0.002).
- Kaplan–Meier survival estimates at two years: 23% in the device group vs. 8% in the medical-therapy group (P=0.09).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Serious adverse events rate was higher in the device group (ratio of 2.35).
- Quality of life at one year was significantly improved in the device group.
- Hospitalization: both the median number of days in and out of the hospital were higher in the device group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Adverse events associated with the left ventricular assist device, including infection and mechanical failure, were a significant concern.
- The trial’s limitations included the obviousness of the device and associated surgical risk, precluding a double-blind design.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- The trial was supported in part by a cooperative agreement with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health and Thoratec Corporation.
