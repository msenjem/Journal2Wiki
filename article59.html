 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Telmisartan is equivalent to ramipril in patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes in terms of reducing mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular causes but is associated with less angioedema. The combination of the two drugs was associated with more adverse events without an increase in benefit.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are beneficial in patients with heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, vascular disease, or high-risk diabetes. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been proposed as an alternative due to possible increased effectiveness and fewer side effects like angioedema and cough.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines may not have fully incorporated the results of this trial at the time of its publication, typically emphasizing the role of ACE inhibitors in this patient population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET), multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">25,620 patients with coronary, peripheral, cerebrovascular disease, or diabetes with end-organ damage.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Ramipril group (n=8576): Received 10 mg of Ramipril per day.
- Telmisartan group (n=8542): Received 80 mg of Telmisartan per day.
- Combination therapy (n=8502): Received both drugs.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: Composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.
- Secondary: Death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Use of a run-in period could have selected patients more likely to tolerate both medications, potentially influencing outcomes.
- No definitive benefit observed with additional blood-pressure lowering, raising questions about possible harm with full-dose multi-drug blockade of the renin-angiotensin system.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by Boehringer Ingelheim, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario, and a Senior Scientist Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
