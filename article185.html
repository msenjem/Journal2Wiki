 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Daily interruption of sedative-drug infusions in critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation decreases the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of stay in the intensive care unit.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Continuous sedative infusions in the intensive care unit are associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, extended ICU stays, and increased difficulty in performing and interpreting daily neurological exams, which may lead to additional diagnostic tests. The routine daily interruption of sedative-drug infusions may mitigate these issues by providing a consistent level of comfort while allowing periodic patient assessment.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Current guidelines for ICU management of mechanically ventilated patients and sedative use are not reported in this article.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N=128 adult patients
- Intervention: Daily interruption of sedative-drug infusions until patients were awake
- Control: Interruption of sedation at clinician discretion
- Setting: Medical intensive care unit
- Enrollment: Data not specified
- Mean follow-up: Duration of ICU stay
- Primary efficacy outcome: Duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation
- Requiring sedation with continuous intravenous infusion
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Pregnancy
- Transfer from outside institution where sedation already administered
- Admission after resuscitation from cardiac arrest
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- The groups were similar regarding demographics, APACHE II scores, reason for ICU admission, and type of respiratory failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Interruption of sedative-drug infusions (midazolam or propofol) and morphine simultaneously until patients were awake or uncomfortable/agitated, requiring sedation resumption (intervention group).
- Control group received continuous infusions with the interruption at clinicians' discretion.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Shorter median duration of mechanical ventilation in the intervention group (4.9 vs. 7.3 days, P=0.004)
- Shorter median length of ICU stay in the intervention group (6.4 vs. 9.9 days, P=0.02)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Fewer patients in the intervention group required diagnostic tests to assess the change in mental status (P=0.02). 
- No significant difference in adverse events such as self-extubation or other complications between groups.
- No significant difference in overall hospital length of stay between groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- The awareness of study-group assignments may have affected care provider decisions, although this was minimized by not disclosing study endpoints.
- Study results are specific to medical ICU patients; applicability to surgical or trauma ICU patients is not established.
- Monitoring subjective discomfort may not reflect less obvious types of discomfort or psychological distress.
