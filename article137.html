 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">In patients with heart failure already treated with prescribed therapy including ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, does the addition of valsartan improve mortality and morbidity?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Valsartan significantly reduced the combined endpoint of mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients when added to prescribed therapy, without affecting overall mortality. However, it had an adverse effect on mortality in the subgroup receiving valsartan in combination with both an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Despite the use of angiotensin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers, heart failure remains a major cause of hospitalization and mortality. Valsartan, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, was tested to see if it could further reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients already on optimal therapy.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">This study, known as the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT), showed that valsartan reduced the combined endpoint (cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or IV inotropic or vasodilator therapy) by 13.2% compared to placebo, predominantly due to a lower number of hospitalizations for heart failure. However, overall mortality did not differ significantly between the valsartan and placebo groups.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">A post hoc analysis raised safety concerns about the specific combination of valsartan, an ACE inhibitor, and a beta-blocker, showing an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity in this subgroup.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers as standard therapy for heart failure due to their proven efficacy in reducing mortality, but they do not specifically address the combination of these with valsartan. The Val-HeFT findings suggest valsartan could have a role in heart failure management, except possibly in those already on both an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker.
