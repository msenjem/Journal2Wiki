 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with septic shock, administration of hydrocortisone did not improve survival at 28 days, regardless of the patients' adrenal responsiveness to corticotropin, although it hastened the reversal of shock.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Corticosteroid use in septic shock has been a controversial topic, with previous research suggesting it might be beneficial particularly in patients with inadequate response to corticotropin. The CORTICUS study examined the effect of low-dose hydrocortisone on survival and shock reversal among a broad population of septic shock patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend the use of corticosteroids in septic shock only in certain circumstances, and previous results suggested potential benefits in non-responders to corticotropin.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">499 patients hospitalized with septic shock.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Hydrocortisone group (251 patients): Received 50 mg of intravenous hydrocortisone every 6 hours for 5 days, then tapered over a 6-day period.
- Placebo group (248 patients): Received placebo at the same intervals.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Death at 28 days among patients who did not have a response to corticotropin.
- Secondary Outcomes: Death at 28 days among patients who had a response to corticotropin and among all patients, reversal of organ system failure, duration of the ICU and hospital stay, and safety assessed by recording adverse events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- A lower number of participants was enrolled compared to the projected sample size, affecting the power of the study.
- Etomidate, which can inhibit corticosteroid metabolism and was used prior to trial enrollment, may have confounded the results.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by the European Commission, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Critical Care Research Network, the International Sepsis Forum, and the Gorham Foundation. Roche Diagnostics supplied the cortisol assay.
