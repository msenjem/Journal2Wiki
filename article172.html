 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In critically ill patients, does a restrictive strategy of red-cell transfusion (maintaining hemoglobin 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter) compared with a liberal strategy (maintaining hemoglobin 10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter) affect 30-day mortality?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A restrictive transfusion strategy maintaining hemoglobin levels between 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter in critically ill patients was at least as effective as and possibly superior to a liberal transfusion strategy, potentially reducing the average number of red-cell units transfused and 30-day mortality. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Previous strategies involving liberal red-cell transfusions in critically ill patients to augment oxygen delivery were challenged by concerns over potential transfusion-related complications and the scarcity of blood. The study compared the effects of maintaining lower (7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter) versus higher (10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter) hemoglobin levels in critically ill patients and found that a restrictive approach to red-cell transfusion may be superior in reducing mortality rates and associated complications.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines may reflect on the results of this study by recommending a more conservative approach to transfusions in critically ill patients, with specific considerations for individual clinical circumstances.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial
- N=838 critically ill patients with euvolemia and hemoglobin <9.0 g per deciliter within 72 hours after ICU admission
- Restrictive strategy (n=418): Transfusion if hemoglobin <7.0 g per deciliter (target 7.0-9.0 g per deciliter)
- Liberal strategy (n=420): Transfusion if hemoglobin <10.0 g per deciliter (target 10.0-12.0 g per deciliter)
- Setting: 25 hospitals in Canada
- Enrollment: November 1994 to November 1997
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Mortality from any cause at 30 days
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Critically ill patients expected to stay in ICU >24 hours, with hemoglobin concentration ≤9.0 g per deciliter within 72 hours of ICU admission, considered euvolemic after initial treatment.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria: Age <16 years, refusal of blood products, active blood loss at enrollment, chronic anemia, pregnancy, brain death, treatment withholding or withdrawal decisions, post-routine cardiac surgery.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics: Similar between groups, average age 57.6 years, average APACHE II score 21, majority on mechanical ventilation, and common admission reasons were respiratory and cardiac diseases.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients managed according to the transfusion strategy to which they were assigned during their ICU stay.
- Suggestions for use of fluids and vasoactive drugs provided.
- Other management decisions left to discretion of physicians.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes: 30-day mortality was 18.7% in the restrictive-strategy group compared to 23.3% in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.11).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Hospitalization mortality was lower in the restrictive-strategy group (22.2% vs. 28.1%, P=0.05).
- Rates of multiorgan failure did not significantly differ between groups.
- 60-day mortality, ICU mortality, and survival time in the first 30 days showed no significant differences.
- Rates of cardiac complications favored the restrictive strategy (P<0.01).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Potential impact of noncompliance with transfusion protocols and physician crossover between treatment groups on the results.
- While representing a variety of critical illnesses, the trial excluded certain patient populations, thus limiting the generalizability of findings to all critically ill patients.
