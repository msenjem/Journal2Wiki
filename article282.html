 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">In children and adults in status epilepticus treated by paramedics, is intramuscular midazolam as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation and might be superior in terminating seizures before hospital arrival in patients with status epilepticus treated by paramedics.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">The RAMPART trial was a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing the efficacy of intramuscular midazolam to intravenous lorazepam for the treatment of patients in status epilepticus by paramedics. The primary outcome, absence of seizures upon arrival in the emergency department without rescue therapy, was achieved more often with intramuscular midazolam than with intravenous lorazepam, demonstrating noninferiority and potential superiority of intramuscular midazolam.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">At the time of publication, no guidelines were provided within the article.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial.
- N=893 subjects (with a total of 1023 enrollments, reenrollment rate 13%).
- Intramuscular midazolam (n=448) vs. Intravenous lorazepam (n=445).
- Setting: 33 EMS agencies, 79 receiving hospitals across the United States.
- Enrollment: June 15, 2009 to January 14, 2011.
- Follow-up at hospital discharge or 30 days after enrollment.
- Intention-to-treat analysis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Children with an estimated body weight of â‰¥13 kg and adults requiring benzodiazepines for status epilepticus in prehospital setting.
- Continuous convulsions for >5 minutes or having convulsive seizures after intermittent seizures without regaining consciousness for >5 minutes.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Acute precipitant of seizures: major trauma, hypoglycemia, cardiac arrest, heart rate of <40 bpm.
- Known allergies to midazolam or lorazepam.
- Known pregnancy or prisoner status.
- Participation in another study.
- Opted out of the trial by wearing a medical-alert tag marked "RAMPART declined".
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Balanced groups regarding demographic and clinical characteristics.
- History of epilepsy, diagnosis of status epilepticus, and underlying cause analysis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Intramuscular midazolam autoinjector followed by intravenous placebo, or
- Intramuscular placebo followed by intravenous lorazepam.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Absence of seizures upon arrival in the emergency department without the need for rescue therapy: 73.4% in the intramuscular midazolam group vs. 63.4% in the intravenous lorazepam group (absolute difference, 10 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.0 to 16.1; P<0.001 for noninferiority and superiority).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Need for endotracheal intubation: 14.1% with intramuscular midazolam vs. 14.4% with intravenous lorazepam.
- Recurrence of seizures: 11.4% with intramuscular midazolam vs. 10.6% with intravenous lorazepam.
- Median times to active treatment and cessation of convulsions: Faster with intramuscular route than intravenous.
- Adverse-event rates similar in the two groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- The importance of using an autoinjector for intramuscular injections, as compared with conventional intramuscular injections, is not determined.
- The study was not designed to separate the effect of the agent from the route of administration.
- No placebo control group; however, including one would have been unethical due to established benefit of benzodiazepines over no treatment.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health Office of the Director CounterACT Program, and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response.
- Autoinjectors provided through a cooperative agreement with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke by the Department of Defense.
