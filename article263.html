 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Immediate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive adults with a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter provided net benefits over starting therapy after the CD4+ count had declined to 350 cells per cubic millimeter.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (START) trial was designed to determine the risks and benefits of immediate versus deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with high CD4+ counts. The trial concluded with strong evidence supporting the immediate initiation of therapy, showing benefits for both serious AIDS-related and serious non–AIDS-related events, with no increased adverse effects.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The results of this trial provide evidence that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended for all patients diagnosed with HIV, regardless of CD4+ count, aligning individual health benefits with public health goals to reduce HIV transmission.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
- N=4,685 HIV-positive adults with a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter 
- Immediate antiretroviral therapy (n=2,326) 
- Deferred antiretroviral therapy (n=2,359) 
- Median follow-up: 3.0 years 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adults aged ≥18 years 
- HIV-positive 
- CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter 
- No history of AIDS 
- Generally good health 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy 
- Deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy until CD4+ count decreased to 350 cells per cubic millimeter, development of AIDS, or another condition dictating the use of therapy 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcome: Composite of any serious AIDS-related event, serious non–AIDS-related event, or death from any cause 
- Secondary outcomes: Serious AIDS-related events, serious non–AIDS-related events, death from any cause, grade 4 events, and unscheduled hospitalizations 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Despite the long duration of the study, 3 years is a short period for patients expected to require lifelong therapy, and the impact of long-term therapy is still uncertain.
- The absolute differences in outcomes between immediate and deferred therapy groups were small, impacting decision-making for some low-risk patients.
- The study did not fully evaluate the effects of immediate therapy on individual serious non-AIDS conditions like cardiovascular disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and several other institutes and international bodies.
- Antiretroviral drugs were donated by several pharmaceutical companies.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The full START study report, supplementary materials, and editorial comments are available at the New England Journal of Medicine website. </span></p>
