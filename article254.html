 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Crizanlizumab significantly decreased the frequency of sickle cell–related pain crises compared to placebo and showed a low rate of adverse effects in patients with sickle cell disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Sickle cell–related pain crises significantly impact quality of life and contribute to morbidity in patients with sickle cell disease. Crizanlizumab, a P-selectin inhibitor, was theorized to reduce cell adhesion and subsequent vaso-occlusion, potentially decreasing the incidence of pain crises. The phase 2 SUSTAIN trial found that high-dose crizanlizumab reduced the annual rate of pain crises by 45.3% in the treatment group compared to placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last update, there is no specific mention of crizanlizumab in current guidelines for the treatment of sickle cell disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.
N=198 patients with sickle cell disease.
Intervention groups: low-dose crizanlizumab (2.5 mg/kg), high-dose crizanlizumab (5.0 mg/kg), vs. placebo.
52 weeks of intravenous treatment followed by a 6-week follow-up.
Primary outcome: Sickle cell–related pain crises rate.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Patients 16-65 years old with sickle cell disease experiencing 2-10 pain crises in the previous 12 months.
Exclusion Criteria: Long-term red-cell transfusion therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">High-dose crizanlizumab (5.0 mg/kg), low-dose crizanlizumab (2.5 mg/kg), or placebo given intravenously.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes: Annual rate of pain crises was 1.63 with high-dose crizanlizumab vs. 2.98 with placebo (45.3% lower rate with high-dose, P=0.01).
Secondary Outcomes:
- Median time to first crisis: 4.07 months with high-dose vs. 1.38 months with placebo (P=0.001).
- Median time to second crisis: 10.32 months with high-dose vs. 5.09 months with placebo (P=0.02).
- A nonsignificant reduction in the median rate of days hospitalized (P=0.45).
- A 62.9% lower rate in annual uncomplicated crises (P=0.02).
- No significant effect on the acute chest syndrome.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Long-term safety and immunogenicity require further monitoring.
- No significant changes were observed in markers of hemolysis.
- The impact on patients with genotypes other than HbSS needs further investigation.
