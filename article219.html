 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Teenage girls who were provided contraception at no cost and educated about LARCs had substantially lower rates of pregnancy, birth, and abortion compared to national rates for sexually experienced teens.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The U.S. has high rates of teenage pregnancy relative to other developed nations, with significant associated costs. The Contraceptive CHOICE Project aimed to reduce unintended pregnancy by promoting LARC methods among teens in the St. Louis region. The project enrolled 1404 girls aged 15 to 19 years and provided them with free birth control and education on LARCs. Study results showed significantly reduced pregnancy, birth, and abortion rates among participants compared to national rates among sexually experienced U.S. teens.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">No specific guidelines were stated, but the study suggested that comprehensive contraceptive education and free access to LARCs could be effective strategies in reducing teenage pregnancy, which align with the CDC's Winnable Battles initiative's goals.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Prospective cohort study
- Participants: 1404 teenage girls and women aged 15 to 19
- Intervention: Free contraception and education on reversible contraception with an emphasis on LARCs
- Time Period: Enrolled from 2007 through 2011, followed for 2 to 3 years
- Primary Outcomes: Rates of pregnancy, live birth, and induced abortion among participants
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: English-speaking or Spanish-speaking, St. Louis region residents, no pregnancy plans for at least 12 months, sexually active or planning to be active
- Exclusion Criteria: History of sterilization or hysterectomy
- Baseline Characteristics: Nearly half reported a previous unintended pregnancy and 18% had a history of abortion
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Participants were offered free contraception of their choice after receiving standardized contraceptive counseling emphasizing the efficacy of LARC methods.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Pregnancy rates in the CHOICE cohort were 34.0 per 1000 teens compared to 158.5 per 1000 sexually experienced U.S. teens nationally
- Birth rates were 19.4 per 1000 compared to 94.0 per 1000 sexually experienced U.S. teens nationally
- Abortion rates were 9.7 per 1000 compared to 41.5 per 1000 sexually experienced U.S. teens nationally
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Self-reported data may underestimate pregnancy numbers
- Regular surveys may have influenced method adherence
- Questionable generalizability due to study's design and approach to counseling
- Majority were black, sexually experienced, and at greater unintended pregnancy risk
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and others.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Detailed study information and supplementary material can be found in the respective publication from The New England Journal of Medicine titled "Contraceptive CHOICE Project and Its Impact on Teen Pregnancy". </span></p>
