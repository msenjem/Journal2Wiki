 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does finasteride reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men 55 years of age or older?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Finasteride reduced the risk of prostate cancer by 24.8% but was associated with an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer and sexual side effects, whereas urinary symptoms were more common in men receiving placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Finasteride is known to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, potentially affecting the development of prostate cancer. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to test the effects of finasteride on the prevention of prostate cancer in men 55 years and older.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time of publication, guidelines for the use of finasteride as a preventive measure against prostate cancer were not established.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized controlled trial
- N=18,882 men aged 55 or older
- Finasteride 5 mg per day vs. placebo
- Mean follow-up: 7 years (terminated 15 months early)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Men aged 55 years or older
- Normal digital rectal examination
- Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 3.0 ng per milliliter or lower
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Clinically significant coexisting conditions that would prevent compliance
- American Urological Association symptom score of 20 or higher
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Median age, race or ethnicity, family history of prostate cancer, PSA level at randomization not detailed in the Wiki
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Finasteride 5 mg daily or placebo for seven years
- Annual digital rectal examinations and PSA measurements
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Prevalence of prostate cancer during the seven-year study period (18.4% in the finasteride group vs. 24.4% in the placebo group)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Tumors with a Gleason grade of 7-10 were more common in the finasteride group (37.0%) than in the placebo group (22.2%)
- Sexual side effects more common in finasteride group
- Urinary symptoms more common in placebo group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported in part by Public Health Service grants from the National Cancer Institute.
