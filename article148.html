 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Routine use of supplemental oxygen in patients with suspected myocardial infarction who are not hypoxemic does not reduce one-year all-cause mortality.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Routine oxygen therapy has been used for over a century in the treatment of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. This practice is based on the idea that increasing oxygen delivery to ischemic myocardium could limit infarct size. The Determination of the Role of Oxygen in Suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction (DETO2X-AMI) trial explored the benefit of supplemental oxygen compared to ambient air in reducing mortality in these patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines generally recommend supplemental oxygen only if hypoxemia is present. Previous studies, including the small AVOID trial and SOCCER trial, indicated possible harm or no benefit with routine oxygen therapy. This trial adds further evidence against the routine use of supplemental oxygen in non-hypoxemic myocardial infarction patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, registry-based, randomized, open-label trial
- Patients with suspected myocardial infarction and oxygen saturation ≥90% were included
- Intervention: supplemental oxygen (6 L/min, 6-12 hours through an open face mask) vs. ambient air
- N=6629 patients
- Mean follow-up: 1 year
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- 6629 patients with suspected myocardial infarction and not hypoxemic
- Included age ≥30 years, symptoms suggestive of myocardial infarction (<6 hours), an oxygen saturation of 90% or higher
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients randomly assigned to receive supplemental oxygen vs. ambient air
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcome: Death from any cause within 1 year after randomization
- Secondary outcomes: Death within 30 days, rehospitalization with myocardial infarction within 1 year
- Analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- No significant difference in 1-year all-cause mortality (5.0% in oxygen group vs. 5.1% in ambient air group; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79-1.21)
- No significant difference in rehospitalization with myocardial infarction within 1 year or at 30 days
- No significant difference in the highest troponin levels during hospitalization between the groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open-label design could introduce bias
- The primary end point does not require adjudication, and the secondary outcomes are from a registry, not centrally adjudicated
- Power calculation based on higher anticipated mortality rate than observed, making the actual power of the study lower than planned
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Supported by Swedish Heart–Lung Foundation, Swedish Research Council, and Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research
