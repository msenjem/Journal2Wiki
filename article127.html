 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Sacubitril-valsartan did not lead to a statistically significant reduction in total hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular death compared to valsartan alone in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and effective therapies have been elusive. The PARAGON-HF trial investigated the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril-valsartan, already proven in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), for potential benefits in HFpEF patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Guidelines have not yet reflected the results of this trial as of the knowledge cutoff date.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, active-comparator trial.
- Patients were assigned to sacubitril-valsartan (n=2419; target dose, 97 mg of sacubitril with 103 mg of valsartan twice daily) or valsartan (n=2403; target dose, 160 mg twice daily).
- The median follow-up duration was 35 months.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Enrolled 4822 patients with NYHA class II-IV heart failure, ejection fraction ≥ 45%, elevated levels of natriuretic peptides, and structural heart disease.
- Median age: 73 years, 52% female, median ejection fraction 57%.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- After a single-blind run-in period with half-target doses, participants who tolerated both drugs without issues were randomized to either sacubitril-valsartan or valsartan.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcome: Composite of total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes.
- Secondary outcomes: NYHA class change, worsening renal function, and change in KCCQ clinical summary score.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial did not meet its primary endpoint, with a primary event rate ratio of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.75-1.01; P=0.06) favoring sacubitril-valsartan. Subgroup analyses suggested potential benefit in women and patients with lower ejection fractions. Secondary outcomes showed some improvements in NYHA class and fewer cases of worsening renal function with sacubitril-valsartan versus valsartan.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial narrowly missed statistical significance, and multiple secondary analyses suggested potential benefits, generating debate about the clinical application of the findings.
- Subgroup analyses were not prespecified primary endpoints, limiting the conclusiveness of results for specific patient demographics.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Novartis.
