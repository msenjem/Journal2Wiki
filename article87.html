 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Colchicine at a dose of 0.5 mg once daily reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease when compared to placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The LoDoCo2 trial aimed to address the potential benefits of antiinflammatory therapy with colchicine among patients with chronic coronary disease. Previous studies, including the COLCOT trial and the original LoDoCo trial, indicated benefits of colchicine in reducing cardiovascular events in post-myocardial infarction patients and those with chronic coronary disease. This trial aimed to confirm these findings in a larger, randomized, double-blind setting.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not include recommendations on the use of colchicine for chronic coronary disease (as of the knowledge cutoff date).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, event-driven trial.
- N=5,552.
- Colchicine 0.5mg once daily (n=2,762).
- Placebo (n=2,760).
- Enrollment: 2014-2018 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adults aged 35-82 years with evidence of chronic coronary disease.
- Exclusion criteria included moderate-to-severe renal impairment, severe heart failure, severe valvular heart disease, or known adverse effects from colchicine.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Colchicine 0.5 mg once daily or matching placebo after a 1-month open-label run-in period.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: A composite of cardiovascular death, spontaneous myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or ischemia-driven coronary revascularization.
- Secondary: A composite of cardiovascular death, spontaneous myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke.
- Other outcomes: Spontaneous myocardial infarction or ischemia-driven coronary revascularization and others.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial population included a lower percentage of women than expected based on the prevalence of chronic coronary disease in the general population. 
- Blood pressure and lipid levels were not collected at baseline or during the trial; therefore, outcomes according to risk-factor control could not be reported. 
- There was no routine measurement of C-reactive protein or other inflammatory markers.
- The difference in noncardiovascular death rates between groups was not statistically significant but could be a potential concern.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The National Health Medical Research Council of Australia and several other agencies and organizations.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT)
