 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">For patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy, is extended anticoagulation with apixaban effective in preventing recurrence without increasing the risk of major bleeding?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Extended anticoagulation with apixaban at doses of 2.5 mg or 5 mg twice daily reduced the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism without increasing the rate of major bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Venous thromboembolism, comprising deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a leading cause of vascular disease-related mortality. Treatment beyond 6 to 12 months presents a challenge due to the inconvenience and bleeding risk associated with warfarin, the standard anticoagulant. AMPLIFY-EXT assessed apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, for extended thromboprophylaxis post initial anticoagulation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last knowledge update, no guidelines reflecting the results of this trial could be found.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=2,486
- Apixaban 2.5mg (n=840)
- Apixaban 5mg (n=813)
- Placebo (n=829)
- Setting: 328 centers in 28 countries
- Enrollment: 2008-2011
- Follow-Up: 12 months
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary Outcome: Composite of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism or death from any cause
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age â‰¥18 years
- Symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
- 6-12 months of anticoagulation therapy completed
- Clinical equipoise regarding continuation or cessation of anticoagulation
Exclusion Criteria
- Contraindication to continued anticoagulant therapy or need for ongoing treatment with other anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents
- Blood dyscrasias and other exclusions outlined in the study protocol
Baseline Characteristics
- Demographic and clinical characteristics well balanced between groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 2.5 mg or 5 mg of apixaban or placebo, all given twice daily for 12 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Composite of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism or death from any cause was significantly lower with apixaban 2.5 mg (3.8%) and 5 mg (4.2%) compared to placebo (11.6%)
Secondary Outcome
- Composite of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism or venous thromboembolism-related death; apixaban was superior to placebo
- Rates of major bleeding were similar across apixaban and placebo groups
Additional Analyses
- Assessment of arterial thrombotic events alongside confirmatory results for efficacy and safety
Adverse Events
- Similar rates of adverse events across all groups
Subgroup Analysis
- Results were consistent among various defined subgroups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- More data needed to determine benefit-to-risk profile in specific populations such as older patients, or those with low body weight or renal impairment
- Limited data on extended treatment beyond 18 to 24 months
