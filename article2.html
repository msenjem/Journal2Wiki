 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients undergoing PCI and receiving guideline-recommended therapy, does cangrelor compared to clopidogrel reduce periprocedural ischemic complications without increasing the risk of severe bleeding?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients undergoing PCI, cangrelor reduced ischemic events, including stent thrombosis during PCI, with no significant increase in severe bleeding compared to clopidogrel.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Cangrelor is a rapid-onset, reversible intravenous ADP P2Y12 inhibitor which may provide a benefit over clopidogrel in reducing ischemic complications during PCI. The CHAMPION PHOENIX trial compared cangrelor to clopidogrel in 11,145 patients undergoing urgent or elective PCI and found that cangrelor reduced the rate of the composite of death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis at 48 hours.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The role of cangrelor during PCI has not been fully reflected in current guidelines.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
- N=11,145 patients undergoing urgent or elective PCI.
- Cangrelor + clopidogrel placebo (n=5,571).
- Clopidogrel + cangrelor placebo (n=5,574).
- Setting: 153 sites globally.
- Enrollment: September 30, 2010, to October 3, 2012.
- Primary efficacy outcome: Composite of death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis at 48 hours.
- Primary safety outcome: Severe bleeding at 48 hours.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Coronary atherosclerosis requiring PCI for stable angina, non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, or STEMI
- Not received pretreatment with platelet inhibitors
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Receipt of P2Y12 inhibitor or abciximab within 7 days before randomization
- Receipt of eptifibatide or tirofiban or fibrinolytic therapy within 12 hours before randomization.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age 64 years.
- 28% were female.
- 56.1% stable angina, 25.7% non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, 18.2% STEMI.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Cangrelor was administered as a bolus followed by an infusion for at least 2 hours or the duration of the procedure, whichever was longer.
- Clopidogrel loading dose determined by site investigator (600 mg or 300 mg).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Rate of primary composite efficacy end point at 48 hours was 4.7% in the cangrelor group vs. 5.9% in the clopidogrel group (adjusted odds ratio 0.78; P=0.005).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Stent thrombosis developed in 0.8% in the cangrelor group and 1.4% in the clopidogrel group (odds ratio, 0.62; P=0.01).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The role of cangrelor in patients pretreated with oral P2Y12 inhibitors or those who require transition to prasugrel or ticagrelor was not assessed in this trial.
- A further study is needed to determine the most effective way to transition from cangrelor to other P2Y12 inhibitors.
