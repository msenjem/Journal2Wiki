 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does early integration of palliative care with standard oncologic care improve quality of life, mood, survival, and end-of-life care among patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early palliative care led to significant improvements in both quality of life and mood among patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer. Compared to patients receiving standard oncologic care, those receiving early palliative care had less aggressive care at the end of life and longer survival.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer is a debilitating disease which results in high symptom burden and poor quality of life, with a survival prognosis less than one year. This study demonstrates the beneficial impact of introducing palliative care early in the disease continuum, significantly improving patient quality of life, mood, and survival.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">This trial's results encourage early integration of palliative care in the management of patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer, altering previous models which introduced palliative care late in the course of the disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Nonblinded, randomized, controlled trial with two groups:
1. Early palliative care integrated with standard oncologic care.
2. Standard oncologic care alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Adult patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer enrolled within 8 weeks after diagnosis.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Pathologically confirmed metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer
- Performance status 0, 1, or 2
- Able to read and respond to questions in English
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Already receiving palliative care
- Unable to provide informed consent
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
No significant differences in demographic characteristics or known prognostic factors between the two groups. Baseline quality of life and mood symptoms were also well-matched.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">1. Early palliative care group: initial visit within 3 weeks after enrollment and at least monthly outpatient visits thereafter.
2. Standard care group: standard oncologic care without scheduled palliative care visits unless requested.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Change in quality of life from baseline to 12 weeks, measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Lung (FACT-L) scale.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Mood, assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9.
- Survival, aggressive end-of-life care, and documentation of resuscitation preferences.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Single-site study limiting generalizability
- Lack of diversity in the patient population
- Potential influences of non-specific care aspects
- Open-label design
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by an American Society of Clinical Oncology Career Development Award and philanthropic gifts from the Joanne Hill Monahan Cancer Fund and Golf Fights Cancer.
