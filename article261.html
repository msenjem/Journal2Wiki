 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Azidothymidine (AZT) demonstrated a reduction in mortality and opportunistic infections in a selected group of subjects with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex, over the 8 to 24 weeks of observation in this study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study established the efficacy of AZT in reducing mortality and morbidity among patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex. AZT was associated with improvements in clinical status, CD4 cell counts, skin-test reactivity, and p24 antigen levels.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study findings led to the establishment of AZT as a treatment option for patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex. Subsequent treatment guidelines for HIV/AIDS would consider these findings in their recommendations.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
- N=282 patients with AIDS manifested by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or with advanced AIDS-related complex
- Intervention: 250 mg of AZT orally every 4 hours
- Duration: 24 weeks
- Outcomes measured included mortality, opportunistic infections, clinical status, and immunological markers
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Patients with AIDS and a first episode of P. carinii pneumonia confirmed within the preceding 120 days, or patients with advanced ARC
- Exclusion Criteria: Multiple opportunistic infections, neoplasm, hemoglobin <9.5 g/dL, absolute CD4 count >500 cells/mm³, recent antiretroviral therapy, and other specified conditions
- Baseline Characteristics: Comparable age, weight, performance status, symptoms, and CD4 cells between AZT and placebo groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Participants randomized to receive either AZT or placebo
- Criteria for response: Survival, occurrence of opportunistic infections, Karnofsky performance score, stable weight, improved number of CD4 cells
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcomes: Mortality and occurrence of opportunistic infections
- Secondary Outcomes: Karnofsky performance status, weight changes, CD4 cell counts, skin-test reactivity, serum p24 antigen levels
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Early termination limited long-term safety and efficacy conclusions.
- The study did not assess the effectiveness of AZT beyond 24 weeks and larger patient subsets to confirm generalizability.
- There were concerns regarding the cumulative toxicity of AZT and durability of immunological benefits.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The study was funded by the Burroughs Wellcome Co., the manufacturer of AZT.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Additional studies and trials have since been conducted to assess the long-term benefits and optimal dosing of AZT, which have further informed treatment guidelines and regimens for HIV/AIDS.
- Consideration of AZT's role in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and the subsequent evolution of HIV treatment strategies. </span></p>
