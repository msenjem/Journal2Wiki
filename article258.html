 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In hospitalized patients with Covid-19, dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone but not among patients without respiratory support.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Severe Covid-19 can lead to respiratory failure and death, potentially related to the host's immune response. The RECOVERY trial evaluated the mortality benefit of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, in hospitalized Covid-19 patients requiring respiratory support. The findings demonstrate that dexamethasone reduces 28-day mortality in patients under invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy but is not beneficial for patients not receiving respiratory support and could potentially be harmful.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Updated guidelines recommend the use of glucocorticoids in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 requiring oxygen with or without ventilatory support.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, controlled, open-label trial
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">6,425 patients hospitalized with Covid-19; 2,104 in the dexamethasone group and 4,321 in the usual care group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomly assigned to receive usual care plus 6 mg of dexamethasone once daily for up to 10 days or usual care alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital discharge within 28 days and progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomization.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open-label design without placebo control
- Dexamethasone not beneficial for patients without respiratory support
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by the Medical Research Council, National Institute for Health Research, and others.
