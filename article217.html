 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Treatment with sofosbuvir-ribavirin for 12 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 2 infection and for 24 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 3 infection led to high rates of sustained virologic response, providing an alternative to interferon-based regimens.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection often have limited treatment options, especially those who have contraindications to interferon or have previously failed interferon-based therapy. The combination of sofosbuvir, a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor, and ribavirin has shown promise in clinical trials, particularly for these genotypes. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of sofosbuvir-ribavirin in these patient populations, with an original 12-week treatment plan revised during the course due to emerging evidence to 24-weeks for genotype 3 infection. A sustained virologic response was achieved in 93% of genotype 2 patients treated for 12 weeks and 85% of genotype 3 patients treated for 24 weeks, providing an effective interferon-free therapy option.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of August 2017, no updated guidelines reflecting the results of this trial have been published regarding the use of sofosbuvir-ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotypes 2 or 3.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, descriptive study initially designed as a phase 3 trial, later amended to a descriptive study without hypothesis testing due to treatment duration changes based on emerging evidence.
N=419 patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection
Interventions:
- Sofosbuvir (400 mg daily) plus weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks in genotype 2 infection (n=73)
- Sofosbuvir (400 mg daily) plus weight-based ribavirin for 24 weeks in genotype 3 infection (n=250)
Primary endpoint: Sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-therapy
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Age ≥18 years
- Chronic HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection with serum HCV RNA levels ≥10,000 IU/mL
- Eligible regardless of prior interferon-based therapy
- Approximately 20% could have cirrhosis.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Major exclusion criteria detailed in the Supplementary Appendix.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Gender: 40% female
- Cirrhosis: 21%
- Previously treated for HCV infection: 58%
- Characteristics balanced between genotype 2 and 3 patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Sofosbuvir (400 mg daily) orally plus ribavirin orally twice daily for either 12 or 24 weeks depending on HCV genotype.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-therapy
- Genotype 2 infection: 93% achieved sustained virologic response after 12-week treatment
- Genotype 3 infection: 85% achieved sustained virologic response after 24-week treatment
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Original randomized controlled trial design changed due to evolving evidence, leading to a lack of hypothesis testing or formal statistical comparisons.
- Lack of liver biopsy data limits the understanding of liver disease extent and subgroups that might benefit from longer or add-on therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by Gilead Sciences.
