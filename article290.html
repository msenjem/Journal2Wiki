 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Penumbral imaging with CT or MRI did not identify patients who would benefit from endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke, and endovascular treatment with first-generation devices showed no superiority to standard care.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Mechanical thrombectomy has been proposed to be beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, especially when administered within a narrow time window. However, whether advanced imaging could identify a subset of patients that benefit most from endovascular therapy remained uncertain.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">The MR RESCUE trial was a randomized, controlled trial that assigned 118 eligible patients either to undergo mechanical embolectomy with first-generation devices or to receive standard care. It utilized pretreatment computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to stratify patients by penumbral patterns. The study found that a favorable penumbral pattern did not predict better outcomes for patients treated with endovascular therapy, and overall, embolectomy was not superior to standard care.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of publication, no updated guidelines have been reflected based on this study's findings. Moreover, newer-generation stent retrievers, not included in the study, may have different levels of clinical efficacy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, phase 2b, randomized, controlled, open-label, blinded outcome trial
- N=118 patients with large-vessel, anterior-circulation ischemic strokes
- Randomized to mechanical embolectomy (n=64) or standard care (n=54)
- Mean patient age: 65.5 years
- Mean time to enrollment: 5.5 hours
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age between 18 and 85 years
- NIHSS scores of 6 to 29
- Large-vessel, anterior-circulation ischemic stroke
- Randomized within 8 hours after symptom onset
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Any contraindication to endovascular therapy
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age: 65.5 years
- 58% had a favorable penumbral pattern
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Mechanical embolectomy (Merci Retriever or Penumbra System) or standard medical care
- All patients underwent pretreatment CT or MRI brain imaging
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- No significant interaction between pretreatment imaging pattern and treatment assignment based on 90-day modified Rankin scale scores
- Among all patients, no difference in mean scores on the modified Rankin scale between embolectomy and standard care
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Embolectomy was not superior to standard care even in patients with a favorable penumbral pattern
- 90-day mortality was 21%; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was 4%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Limited by the use of first-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices, advances in clinical practices over the 8-year study period, and variable timing in treatment and imaging approaches.
- Study results may not apply to newer-generation thrombectomy devices with reportedly higher rates of revascularization and better clinical outcomes.
