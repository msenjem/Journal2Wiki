 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In an intermediate-risk population without cardiovascular disease, does combined therapy with rosuvastatin, candesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide lower the rate of cardiovascular events more effectively than dual-placebo?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among individuals without cardiovascular disease but at intermediate risk, combined therapy with rosuvastatin, candesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide significantly reduced cardiovascular events compared to dual placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Elevated blood pressure and LDL cholesterol are both associated with increased cardiovascular risk, leading to the hypothesis that their simultaneous management might lead to substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. This approach aligns with the polypill concept, aiming for broad population-based treatment without targets or monitoring, particularly in middle-aged and older adults.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">The HOPE-3 trial used a 2-by-2 factorial design to assess the effects of cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin and blood pressure lowering with candesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide versus respective placebos in a primary prevention population at intermediate risk. This analysis focused specifically on the combined therapy versus dual-placebo comparison.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of August 2017, no guidelines have been published that reflect the results of this trial.

N=12,705
Rosuvastatin (10 mg per day) and candesartan (16 mg per day) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg per day) (n=3180)
Dual placebo (n=3168)
Setting: 228 centers in 21 countries
Enrollment: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00468923
Mean follow-up: 5.6 years
Analysis: Intention-to-treat
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
Men ≥55 years and women ≥65 years without cardiovascular disease with at least one additional risk factor; women ≥60 years with ≥2 additional risk factors
Exclusion Criteria:
Presence of cardiovascular disease
Contraindications to statins, angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, or thiazide diuretics
Baseline Characteristics
Age: 65.7 years (mean)
Female: 46.2%
Baseline systolic BP: 138.1 mmHg (mean)
Baseline LDL cholesterol: 127.8 mg/dL (mean)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Initial run-in with both active treatments
Randomization to one of four groups in a 2x2 design: rosuvastatin (10 mg per day), candesartan (16 mg per day) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg per day), double placebo, or one drug plus the other drug's placebo
Structured lifestyle advice provided individually
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
First coprimary outcome: Death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke
Second coprimary outcome: First coprimary outcome plus resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure, or revascularization
Secondary Outcomes
Composite of second coprimary outcome plus angina with evidence of ischemia
Death from any cause
New-onset diabetes
Muscle weakness and dizziness
Muscle weakness or pain: More common in combined-therapy group (1.7%) vs. dual-placebo group (0.78%)
Dizziness: More common in combined-therapy group (14.2%) vs. dual-placebo group (11.9%)
