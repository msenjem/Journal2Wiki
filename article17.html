 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome, does intensive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin improve cardiovascular outcomes compared to standard lipid-lowering therapy with pravastatin?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">For patients recently hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome, intensive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin offers superior protection against death or major cardiovascular events than standard therapy with pravastatin.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The optimal level of LDL cholesterol for minimizing cardiovascular risk is unclear. Building on evidence that statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events, the PROVE ITâ€“TIMI 22 trial was designed to compare the effects of intensive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin against standard therapy with pravastatin among patients with recent acute coronary syndrome.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend a target LDL cholesterol level of less than 100 mg per deciliter for patients with established coronary artery disease or diabetes. However, findings from this study suggest potential benefits from achieving even lower levels.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=4,162 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome
- High-dose atorvastatin (80 mg daily) vs. standard-dose pravastatin (40 mg daily)
- Median follow-up: 24 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days
- Exclusion Criteria: Certain co-morbid conditions, ongoing statin therapy > 80mg/day, certain medication restrictions, specific lab value abnormalities
- Baseline Characteristics: Average age was 58, 22% were women, and 69% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for their index acute coronary syndrome
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Pravastatin 40 mg daily (standard therapy) versus atorvastatin 80 mg daily (intensive therapy)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, documented unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, revascularization (performed at least 30 days after randomization), and stroke
- Secondary Outcomes: Death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization; and other individual components
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sankyo.
