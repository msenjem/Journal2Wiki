 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does long-term use of ticagrelor reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients 1 to 3 years after a myocardial infarction, long-term ticagrelor at doses of either 90 mg or 60 mg twice daily reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to placebo, but increased the risk of major bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The potential benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year post-myocardial infarction was unclear. Ticagrelor, added to aspirin, efficaciously reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within the first year post-acute coronary syndrome, but its long-term use had not been established in a stable post-myocardial infarction population. The PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial found that ticagrelor continued to provide benefits in such patients over an extended period, albeit with an increased risk of bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time of the study, guidelines recommended P2Y12 receptor antagonists for up to 1 year post-myocardial infarction. This trial suggests potential modification of these recommendations might be warranted to extend the duration of P2Y12 receptor antagonist therapy in post-myocardial infarction patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial
- N=21,162
- Randomization to ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily, or placebo
- Median follow-up: 33 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients aged ≥50 with a history of myocardial infarction 1 to 3 years prior
- Additional risk factors such as age ≥65, diabetes mellitus, another MI, multivessel coronary disease, or chronic renal dysfunction
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily vs. ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily vs. placebo, in addition to low-dose aspirin (75-150 mg daily)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke
- Ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily (7.85%) and 60 mg twice daily (7.77%) each reduced the rate compared to placebo (9.04%)
Secondary Outcomes
- TIMI major bleeding was higher with ticagrelor (2.60% with 90 mg, 2.30% with 60 mg) compared to placebo (1.06%)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial was funded by AstraZeneca.
