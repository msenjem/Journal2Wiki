 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Does mild systemic hypothermia increase the rate of neurologic recovery after resuscitation from cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Mild systemic hypothermia (32°C to 34°C) for 24 hours improves neurologic outcomes and reduces mortality at six months among patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">The study demonstrated the effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia in patients who had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, showing that it increased the chance of good neurologic recovery (defined as a cerebral-performance category of 1 or 2) and decreased mortality at six months. This study contributed to the establishment of therapeutic hypothermia as a standard of care in post-cardiac arrest management for appropriate patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, therapeutic hypothermia was recommended in guidelines such as those by the AHA/ERC for comatose patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with blinded assessment of the outcome.
- N=275 patients with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.
- Hypothermia group (n=137) vs. Normothermia group (n=138).
- Enrollment from March 1996 to January 2001.
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Witnessed cardiac arrest
- Initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia
- Presumed cardiac origin of arrest
- Age between 18 and 75 years
- Resuscitation attempts started 5 to 15 minutes from collapse by emergency medical personnel
- Restoration of spontaneous circulation within 60 minutes from collapse
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Tympanic-membrane temperature below 30°C on admission
- Comatose state due to central nervous system depressants
- Pregnancy
- Response to verbal commands post-resuscitation
- Severe hypotension or hypoxemia post-resuscitation
- Terminal illness pre-arrest
- Cardiac arrest after arrival of medical personnel
- Known coagulopathies
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Groups were generally similar, although patients in the normothermia group were more likely to have histories of diabetes and coronary heart disease and to have received bystander CPR.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Hypothermia group was cooled to a targeted body temperature of 32°C to 34°C for 24 hours using an external cooling device, followed by passive rewarming.
- Normothermia group received standard care with maintenance of normal body temperature.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Favorable neurologic outcome at six months, defined as cerebral-performance category of 1 or 2.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Mortality at six months.
- Rate of complications within seven days post-cardiac arrest.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Mortality and neurologic outcome were significantly improved in the hypothermia group. The rate of complications such as bleeding, pneumonia, sepsis, and arrhythmias did not significantly differ between groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Supported by grants from the European Union, the Austrian Ministry of Science and Transport, and the Austrian Science Foundation. The cooling device was provided by Kinetic Concepts.
