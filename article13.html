 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In stable patients with occluded infarct-related artery days after myocardial infarction, PCI did not reduce the occurrence of death, reinfarction, or heart failure compared to optimal medical therapy alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) examined whether routine PCI for total occlusion of the infarct-related artery in stable patients 3 to 28 days post-myocardial infarction would reduce death, reinfarction, or NYHA class IV heart failure. The study found no clinical benefit of PCI over optimal medical therapy during a mean follow-up of 3 years.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not recommend routine PCI for stable patients with occluded infarct-related artery beyond the period of expected myocardial salvage.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Randomized, controlled trial with 2166 stable patients enrolled between February 2000 and December 2005. Participants were divided into two groups: 1082 assigned to routine PCI plus optimal medical therapy and 1084 to optimal medical therapy alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Total occlusion of infarct-related artery identified 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction
- Ejection fraction <50% or proximal occlusion
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- NYHA class III or IV heart failure, shock, serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL, significant left main or three-vessel coronary artery disease, rest angina, severe ischemia on stress testing
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Participants received either PCI with stenting and optimal medical therapy or optimal medical therapy alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes:
- Composite of death, myocardial reinfarction, or NYHA class IV heart failure
- 4-year cumulative primary event rate was 17.2% (PCI group) and 15.6% (medical therapy group), not statistically significant
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Similar rates of nonfatal reinfarction and NYHA class IV heart failure in both groups
- No interaction observed between treatment effect and any subgroup variable
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Trend towards excess nonfatal reinfarctions in the PCI group raised concerns
- Studies reflecting current PCI practice and use of drug-eluting stents were not performed
- Limitations in the data on thienopyridine use and long-term impact on left ventricular remodeling
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Grants from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and various in-kind and monetary support from the pharmaceutical and medical device industry.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00004562. Additional results can be read in the full text of the study available at www.nejm.org. </span></p>
