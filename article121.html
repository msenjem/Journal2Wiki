 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with chronic heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and iron deficiency, does intravenous iron supplementation improve symptoms and quality of life?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with chronic heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, and iron deficiency, intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) supplementation improves symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life; the side-effect profile is acceptable.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Iron deficiency impairs oxygen transport and utilization, potentially exacerbating symptoms in patients with heart failure. The FAIR-HF trial investigated the effects of intravenous iron supplementation on patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency, with or without anemia, to determine whether it confers symptomatic benefits.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the latest updates, specific guidelines reflecting the results of this trial were not detailed, but might consider intravenous iron supplementation in heart failure patients with confirmed iron deficiency.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Total number of participants: 459
- Inclusion Criteria: Ambulatory patients with heart failure of NYHA functional class II or III, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% (NYHA class II) or ≤45% (NYHA class III), iron deficiency (ferritin <100 μg per liter or 100-299 μg per liter if transferrin saturation <20%), and hemoglobin 95-135 g per liter
- Exclusion Criteria: Uncontrolled hypertension, significant other heart disease, inflammation, or significantly impaired hepatic or renal function
- Baseline Characteristics: Demographically similar groups with respect to clinical and laboratory characteristics
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Ferric carboxymaltose: 200 mg intravenous iron weekly until iron repletion, then monthly for maintenance
- Saline (Placebo): Same regimen as ferric carboxymaltose
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- 50% of patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group reported improvements compared to 28% in the placebo group (odds ratio for improvement, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.75 to 3.61) according to the Patient Global Assessment at week 24
- 47% in the ferric carboxymaltose group had an NYHA functional class I or II at week 24 compared to 30% in placebo (odds ratio for improvement by one class, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.55 to 3.71)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Improvements were seen with ferric carboxymaltose in the distance on the 6-minute walk test and quality-of-life assessments
- Rates of death, adverse events, and serious adverse events were similar between groups
