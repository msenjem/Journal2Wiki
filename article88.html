 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">One month of dual antiplatelet therapy was noninferior to the continuation of therapy for at least 2 additional months regarding the occurrence of net adverse clinical events and major adverse cardiac or cerebral events, and resulted in a lower incidence of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The MASTER DAPT trial evaluated the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at high risk for bleeding after implantation of a biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent. The discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy at a median of 34 days post-PCI did not increase the incidence of net adverse clinical events or major adverse cardiac or cerebral events compared to a longer duration of therapy. However, it did reduce the risk of major bleeding events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not specifically address the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for the patient population included in the MASTER DAPT trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The MASTER DAPT trial was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority, and superiority trial involving 4579 patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients at high bleeding risk who had undergone implantation of a biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent, free from adverse events during the first month post-PCI.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Abbreviated dual antiplatelet therapy (one month duration, n=2295)
- Standard dual antiplatelet therapy (at least three additional months, n=2284)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Net adverse clinical events at 335 days.
- Major adverse cardiac or cerebral events at 335 days.
- Major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding at 335 days.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The open-label design could introduce bias in reporting or management of outcomes.
- The results may not generalize to patients with lower bleeding risk or those who receive different stent types.
- Wide noninferiority margins could potentially miss a modest increase in incidence.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Terumo.
