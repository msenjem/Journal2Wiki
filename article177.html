 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">The selection of intravenous fluid, particularly between balanced crystalloids and saline, has been debated with regards to their impact on patient outcomes in critically ill adults. This study showed that balanced crystalloids reduced the composite outcome of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction in comparison to saline.

- N=15,802 critically ill adults
- Randomized to either balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer’s solution or Plasma-Lyte A) or saline (0.9% sodium chloride)
- Setting: 5 ICUs at an academic center
- Period: June 1, 2015, to April 30, 2017
- Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Major adverse kidney event within 30 days
