 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy improve survival among patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy provides a slight improvement in survival for patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Although complete surgical resection is recognized as an effective treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer, previous randomized trials had not conclusively shown a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Building upon a previous meta-analysis suggesting a potential survival advantage with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT) was designed to compare the effects of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy to observation in patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date for this summary, guidelines regarding the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer should be consulted for the most up-to-date recommendations.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A total of 1867 patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Pathologically documented non-small-cell lung cancer of stage I, II, or III
- Complete surgical resection
- Age between 18 and 75 years
- No previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy
- No other previous cancers except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Contraindications to chemotherapy
- Ineligibility as determined by other clinical factors
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- The study population had stages I, II, or III non-small-cell lung cancer
- The median duration of follow-up was 56 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Randomly assigned to:
- Cisplatin-based chemotherapy (n=932) â€” three or four cycles
- Observation (n=935)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Overall five-year survival rates: 44.5% in the chemotherapy group vs. 40.4% in the observation group (P<0.03)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Disease-free survival rates at five years: 39.4% in the chemotherapy group vs. 34.3% in the observation group (P<0.003)
- No significant interactions with prespecified factors
- Chemotherapy-induced deaths: 0.8%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open-label design
- Selection of adjuvant therapy and radiotherapy was not uniform across centers
- Potential for confounding by differences in radiotherapy administration
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by unrestricted grants from various cancer research associations and institutions.
