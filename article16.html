 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients admitted with an acute coronary syndrome, does ticagrelor reduce the risk of cardiovascular events compared to clopidogrel?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with an acute coronary syndrome, ticagrelor was superior to clopidogrel in reducing the risk of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke, without an increased risk of overall major bleeding but with an increase in non–procedure-related bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended for patients with an acute coronary syndrome. Ticagrelor, a new reversible direct-acting oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist, provides more consistent P2Y12 inhibition than clopidogrel. The PLATO trial compared ticagrelor with clopidogrel in 18,624 patients with acute coronary syndromes and found that ticagrelor reduced the risk of vascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, without an increased risk of overall major bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of 2009, guidelines had not been published that reflect the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial
N=18,624
Ticagrelor (n=9,333)
Clopidogrel (n=9,291)
Mean follow-up: 12 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Hospitalized patients within 24 hours of onset of acute coronary syndromes with or without ST-segment elevation
Exclusion Criteria: Contraindications to clopidogrel, fibrinolytic therapy within 24 hours before randomization, need for oral anticoagulation, increased risk of bradycardia, strong cytochrome P-450 3A inhibitor or inducer therapy
Baseline Characteristics: Well balanced across both groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Ticagrelor – 180 mg loading dose, followed by 90 mg twice daily
Clopidogrel – 300-600 mg loading dose if not previously received, followed by 75 mg daily
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: Death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 12 months
9.8% with ticagrelor vs. 11.7% with clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.92; P<0.001)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Death from any cause: 4.5% with ticagrelor vs. 5.9% with clopidogrel (P<0.001)
No significant difference in the rates of major bleeding between groups
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Subgroup Analysis
Benefit of ticagrelor appeared to be attenuated in patients under median weight, those not taking lipid-lowering drugs at randomization, and those enrolled in North America
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Ticagrelor was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting and more instances of fatal intracranial bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by AstraZeneca.
