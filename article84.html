                                        </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with acute coronary syndromes for whom invasive evaluation is planned, how does ticagrelor compare with prasugrel in preventing death, myocardial infarction, or stroke?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with acute coronary syndromes with or without ST-segment elevation, prasugrel was associated with a significantly lower incidence of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to ticagrelor at 1 year, without a significant difference in the incidence of major bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prior trials have established the individual benefits of third-generation thienopyridine prasugrel and cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine ticagrelor over clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes. However, direct comparisons of ticagrelor and prasugrel in this setting were lacking. The ISAR-REACT 5 trial aimed to address this gap by comparing the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor to prasugrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes for whom invasive evaluation was planned.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the time of the trial, both prasugrel and ticagrelor were recommended (class I) for use in patients with acute coronary syndromes with or without ST-segment elevation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 4 trial comparing ticagrelor and prasugrel.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">4,018 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes (STEMI, NSTEMI, or unstable angina) with planned invasive evaluation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Ticagrelor: Loading dose of 180 mg, maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily.
Prasugrel: Loading dose of 60 mg, maintenance dose of 10 mg daily; a reduced maintenance dose of 5 mg daily was recommended for patients aged 75+ or weight less than 60 kg. Prasugrel loading was administered after coronary anatomy was known in patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: Composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 1 year (ticagrelor 9.3% vs. prasugrel 6.9%; hazard ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.70; P=0.006).
Safety End Point: Major bleeding (BARC type 3 through 5) (ticagrelor 5.4% vs. prasugrel 4.8%; hazard ratio 1.12, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.51; P=0.46).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open-label design may introduce bias.
- Most follow-up conducted by telephone, not face-to-face.
- High incidence of switching to clopidogrel after discharge in a previous head-to-head comparison trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by the German Center for Cardiovascular Research and Deutsches Herzzentrum MÃ¼nchen.
