 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with advanced heart failure, a fully magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow pump is superior to a mechanical-bearing axial-flow pump, with higher survival rates free of disabling stroke or reoperation due to malfunctioning device. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The MOMENTUM 3 trial compared two types of left ventricular assist systems (LVAS): the HeartMate 3 centrifugal-flow pump and the HeartMate II axial-flow pump. At 2 years, the centrifugal-flow pump showed better clinical outcomes than the axial-flow pump, especially in terms of preventing pump-related malfunctions requiring reoperation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Left ventricular assist systems are indicated for advanced heart failure patients as a bridge to transplantation or as destination therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized noninferiority and superiority trial
- 366 patients with advanced heart failure allocated to centrifugal-flow pump (n=190) or axial-flow pump (n=176)
- Primary endpoint: Survival at 2 years free of disabling stroke or reoperation due to device malfunction
- Noninferiority margin: -10 percentage points for the risk difference
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adults with advanced heart failure refractory to medical management
- Excluded if active infection, irreversible organ dysfunction, or needing biventricular support
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to the centrifugal-flow pump (HeartMate 3) or axial-flow pump (HeartMate II), with antithrombotic treatment including aspirin and warfarin.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcome (intention-to-treat): The centrifugal-flow pump group demonstrated a higher rate of the primary endpoint (79.5%) compared to the axial-flow pump group (60.2%) (P<0.001 for noninferiority and superiority).
- Secondary outcomes: Lower rates of reoperation in the centrifugal-flow pump group (1.6% vs. 17.0%, P<0.001) and overall rate of stroke (10.1% vs. 19.2%, P=0.02).
- There was no significant difference in the incidence of disabling stroke or death between the two groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Lack of blinding, which may have introduced bias in the study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by Abbott, the manufacturer of the HeartMate systems.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Full details of the MOMENTUM 3 trial, including data analysis and supplementary material, are available in The New England Journal of Medicine and linked ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02224755. </span></p>
