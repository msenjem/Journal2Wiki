    "Intraaortic Balloon Counterpulsation in Acute Myocardial Infarction-Complicated Cardiogenic Shock"<br/>
<br/>
1. **Clinical Question**<br/>
   - Does intraaortic balloon counterpulsation reduce 30-day mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction-complicated cardiogenic shock who are undergoing early revascularization?<br/>
<br/>
2. **Bottom Line**<br/>
   - In patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction who were planned for early revascularization, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation did not significantly reduce 30-day all-cause mortality compared to conventional therapy alone.<br/>
<br/>
3. **Major Points**<br/>
   - Though listed as a Class I treatment in international guidelines for cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction, existing evidence supporting intraaortic balloon counterpulsation primarily comes from registry data, with a lack of robust randomized clinical trials.<br/><br/>
<br/>
4. **Guidelines**<br/>
   - Prior to this study, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation was recommended as Class IB and IC treatment by U.S. and European guidelines, respectively, for cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction.<br/>
<br/>
5. **Design**<br/>
   - Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial with a total of 600 participants.<br/>
   - Interventions: Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation vs. no intraaortic balloon counterpulsation.<br/>
<br/>
6. **Population**<br/>
   - Inclusion Criteria: Patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (with or without ST-segment elevation) complicated by cardiogenic shock and planned for early revascularization (PCI or CABG).<br/>
   - Exclusion Criteria: Extensive list includes prolonged resuscitation, absent heart action, severe concomitant diseases, and mechanical causes of cardiogenic shock.<br/>
<br/>
7. **Interventions**<br/>
   - Patients were randomized to intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP group - 301 patients) or a control group without intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (control group - 299 patients).<br/>
<br/>
8. **Outcomes**<br/>
   - Primary Outcome: 30-day all-cause mortality. No significant difference between the groups was observed (IABP group 39.7% vs. control group 41.3% with a relative risk of 0.96).<br/>
   - Secondary Outcomes: No significant differences in secondary clinical endpoints or process-of-care measures including time to hemodynamic stabilization, ICU stay length, lactate levels, catecholamine therapy, renal function, and others.<br/>
<br/>
9. **Criticisms**<br/>
   - Lack of blinding due to nature of the intervention.<br/>
   - Absence of detailed hemodynamic measurements.<br/>
   - Not all patients with severe cardiogenic shock were included, raising questions about the generalizability of the study findings to this subset of patients.<br/>
<br/>
10. **Funding**<br/>
   - Funded by the German Research Foundation and others, with unrestricted grants from Maquet Cardiopulmonary and Teleflex Medical.<br/>
<br/>
11. **Further Reading**<br/>
