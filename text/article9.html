 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">   - In patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction who were planned for early revascularization, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation did not significantly reduce 30-day all-cause mortality compared to conventional therapy alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">   - Though listed as a Class I treatment in international guidelines for cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction, existing evidence supporting intraaortic balloon counterpulsation primarily comes from registry data, with a lack of robust randomized clinical trials.
   - The IABP-SHOCK II trial, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial with 600 participants, found no significant difference in 30-day mortality or other secondary endpoints between patients treated with intraaortic balloon counterpulsation and those who received the best available medical therapy without balloon counterpulsation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">   - Prior to this study, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation was recommended as Class IB and IC treatment by U.S. and European guidelines, respectively, for cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">   - Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial with a total of 600 participants.
   - Interventions: Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation vs. no intraaortic balloon counterpulsation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">   - Inclusion Criteria: Patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (with or without ST-segment elevation) complicated by cardiogenic shock and planned for early revascularization (PCI or CABG).
   - Exclusion Criteria: Extensive list includes prolonged resuscitation, absent heart action, severe concomitant diseases, and mechanical causes of cardiogenic shock.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">   - Patients were randomized to intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP group - 301 patients) or a control group without intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (control group - 299 patients).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">   - Primary Outcome: 30-day all-cause mortality. No significant difference between the groups was observed (IABP group 39.7% vs. control group 41.3% with a relative risk of 0.96).
   - Secondary Outcomes: No significant differences in secondary clinical endpoints or process-of-care measures including time to hemodynamic stabilization, ICU stay length, lactate levels, catecholamine therapy, renal function, and others.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">   - Lack of blinding due to nature of the intervention.
   - Absence of detailed hemodynamic measurements.
   - Not all patients with severe cardiogenic shock were included, raising questions about the generalizability of the study findings to this subset of patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">   - Funded by the German Research Foundation and others, with unrestricted grants from Maquet Cardiopulmonary and Teleflex Medical.
