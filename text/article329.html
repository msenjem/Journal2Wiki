 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does pirfenidone reduce disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared to placebo?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Pirfenidone, compared to placebo, reduced disease progression as measured by FVC change, 6-minute walk distance, and progression-free survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and had an acceptable side-effect profile with fewer deaths observed.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disease. Previous phase 3 trials demonstrated mixed results regarding the efficacy of pirfenidone in reducing disease progression. The phase 3 ASCEND trial aimed to confirm pirfenidone's beneficial effect on disease progression in IPF patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Guideline recommendations for the use of pirfenidone in IPF were not addressed as part of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
- N=555 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
- Randomized to receive oral pirfenidone (2403 mg per day) or placebo for 52 weeks
- Primary endpoint: change in FVC or death at week 52
- Secondary endpoints included the 6-minute walk distance, progression-free survival, dyspnea, and death from any cause or from IPF
- Conducted at 127 sites in 9 countries
- Funding: InterMune
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adults aged 40-80 years with centrally confirmed diagnosis of IPF
- Inclusion Criteria: Diagnosed with IPF, FVC 50-90% predicted, FEV1:FVC ratio ≥0.80, 6-minute walk distance ≥150m
- Exclusion Criteria: Symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, NSVT ≥15 PVCs per hour at rate ≥120 bpm, use of investigational therapy, etc. 
- Baseline Characteristics: Majority male and white, average age 65 or older, mean baseline FVC 67.8±11.2% predicted in pirfenidone group and 68.6±10.9% predicted in placebo group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Pirfenidone (2403 mg per day) administered with food in three divided doses, with a gradual dose increase over 2 weeks
- Placebo administered in a similar regimen
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Significant relative reduction of 47.9% in patients with ≥10 percentage points decline in predicted FVC or death with pirfenidone
- Relative increase of 132.5% in patients with no decline in FVC with pirfenidone compared to placebo (P<0.001)
Secondary Outcomes
- Reduce 6-minute walk distance decline (P=0.04)
- Improved progression-free survival (P<0.001)
- No significant difference in dyspnea scores or death rates from any cause or from IPF
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The generalizability to patients with advanced disease and those with significant airflow limitation (FEV1:FVC <0.80) is uncertain
- Central confirmation of diagnosis may not represent the general IPF population
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The study was funded by InterMune.
