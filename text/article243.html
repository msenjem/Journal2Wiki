<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
In patients treated with dabigatran who had serious bleeding or required an urgent procedure, does Idarucizumab reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Idarucizumab rapidly and completely reversed the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran within minutes in the majority of patients and was found to be safe.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Dabigatran is an oral anticoagulant used for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Serious bleeding events can occur, and there may be a need for urgent reversal, such as before surgery. Idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. This prospective cohort study demonstrated that Idarucizumab effectively and rapidly reversed the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
As of 2015, there are no specific guidelines that reflect the results of this trial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Prospective cohort study, ongoing, multicenter<br/>
<br/>
N=90 patients treated with dabigatran experiencing serious bleeding or requiring urgent procedures<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions included receiving 5g of intravenous Idarucizumab</strong></h2><br/>
Mean follow-up: at least 1 month, up to 90 days or until death<br/>
<br/>
Primary Efficacy Outcome: Maximum percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran<br/>
Primary Safety Outcome: Adverse events including thrombotic events and serious adverse events<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Inclusion Criteria: Adults ≥18 years of age taking dabigatran with overt, uncontrollable bleeding (Group A) or who required surgery or other invasive procedures (Group B)<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria: None reported.<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics: Majority were receiving dabigatran for atrial fibrillation; median age was 76.5 years; median creatinine clearance was 58 mL/min<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
All patients received 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Primary Outcome: Among the patients with an elevated dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time at baseline, the median maximum percentage reversal was 100%, with reversal evident within minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes: Hemostasis was restored in a median of 11.4 hours among bleeding patients (Group A) and normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported in 92% of patients undergoing procedures (Group B). One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after idarucizumab administration; 18 deaths overall were reported.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
There was a lack of a control group, as it was deemed unethical to randomly assign patients to receive placebo or no active treatment. Therefore, the cohort design was selected.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim, the developer of Idarucizumab.<br/>
