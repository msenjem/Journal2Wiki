 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">In patients treated with dabigatran who had serious bleeding or required an urgent procedure, does Idarucizumab reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Idarucizumab rapidly and completely reversed the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran within minutes in the majority of patients and was found to be safe.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Dabigatran is an oral anticoagulant used for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Serious bleeding events can occur, and there may be a need for urgent reversal, such as before surgery. Idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. This prospective cohort study demonstrated that Idarucizumab effectively and rapidly reversed the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">As of 2015, there are no specific guidelines that reflect the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Prospective cohort study, ongoing, multicenter
 </span></p><p><span class="main">N=90 patients treated with dabigatran experiencing serious bleeding or requiring urgent procedures
Interventions included receiving 5g of intravenous Idarucizumab
Mean follow-up: at least 1 month, up to 90 days or until death
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Efficacy Outcome: Maximum percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran
Primary Safety Outcome: Adverse events including thrombotic events and serious adverse events
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Adults â‰¥18 years of age taking dabigatran with overt, uncontrollable bleeding (Group A) or who required surgery or other invasive procedures (Group B)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria: None reported.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics: Majority were receiving dabigatran for atrial fibrillation; median age was 76.5 years; median creatinine clearance was 58 mL/min
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">All patients received 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: Among the patients with an elevated dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time at baseline, the median maximum percentage reversal was 100%, with reversal evident within minutes.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Secondary Outcomes: Hemostasis was restored in a median of 11.4 hours among bleeding patients (Group A) and normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported in 92% of patients undergoing procedures (Group B). One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after idarucizumab administration; 18 deaths overall were reported.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">There was a lack of a control group, as it was deemed unethical to randomly assign patients to receive placebo or no active treatment. Therefore, the cohort design was selected.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim, the developer of Idarucizumab.
