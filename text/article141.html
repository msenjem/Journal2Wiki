    "Barbershop Interventions for Blood Pressure Reduction in Black Men". The New England Journal of Medicine. 2018.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does a pharmacist-led intervention program in black-owned barbershops improve blood pressure control in non-Hispanic black men with uncontrolled hypertension?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Among black male barbershop patrons with uncontrolled hypertension, a pharmacist-led intervention program within barbershops resulted in a significantly larger decrease in blood pressure compared to an active control group promoting lifestyle modification and doctor appointments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Non-Hispanic black men have disproportionately higher rates of hypertension-related mortality and lower rates of hypertension treatment and control. Interventions to manage hypertension outside of traditional health care settings may be necessary. This study found that a pharmacist-led intervention in barbershops effectively reduced blood pressure in black men with uncontrolled hypertension.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of August 2017, no specific guidelines reflect the results of this trial for hypertension management in similar community settings.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, cluster-randomized, open-label trial<br/>
N=319 black male patrons of 52 black-owned barbershops<br/>
Pharmacist-led intervention (n=132 in 28 barbershops)<br/>
Active control: encouraged lifestyle changes and doctor appointments (n=171 in 24 barbershops)<br/>
Setting: Black-owned barbershops in Los Angeles County<br/>
Enrollment: February 2015 to July 2017<br/>
Mean follow-up: 6 months<br/>
Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat<br/>
Primary outcome: Change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
Self-identified black male regular patrons aged 35 to 79<br/>
Systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
Women and individuals receiving dialysis or chemotherapy<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
Mean systolic blood pressure: 152.8 mm Hg (intervention) and 154.6 mm Hg (control)<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
In the intervention group, barbers encouraged follow-up with pharmacists who prescribed antihypertensive medication, monitored blood pressure, and adjusted therapy under a collaborative practice agreement with participants’ doctors.<br/>
In the control group, barbers encouraged lifestyle changes and doctor visits.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcomes<br/>
Mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 27.0 mm Hg in the intervention group and by 9.3 mm Hg in the control group.<br/>
The mean reduction was 21.6 mm Hg greater in the intervention group (P&lt;0.001).<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
The intervention group showed a 14.9 mm Hg greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure compared to the control group (P&lt;0.001).<br/>
63.6% of participants in the intervention group achieved a blood pressure &lt;130/80 mm Hg compared to 11.7% in the control group (P&lt;0.001).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
The results may not be generalizable to nonurban areas or different community settings.<br/>
Pharmacist availability and collaboration with physicians may limit the feasibility of implementing this intervention widely.<br/>
