#### "Antipsychotic Medications for Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit"<br/>
The New England Journal of Medicine.  <br/>
Pubmed • Full text • PDF<br/>
<br/>
#### Clinical Question<br/>
Does the use of haloperidol or ziprasidone reduce the duration of delirium in ICU patients with acute respiratory failure or shock?<br/>
<br/>
#### Bottom Line<br/>
In ICU patients with acute respiratory failure or shock, the use of haloperidol or ziprasidone, as compared to placebo, does not significantly alter the duration of delirium.<br/>
<br/>
#### Major Points<br/><br/>
<br/>
#### Guidelines<br/>
Current guidelines do not provide clear recommendations on the use of antipsychotic medications for delirium management in the ICU setting, as results from this study.<br/>
<br/>
#### Design<br/>
- Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial<br/>
- N=566 ICU patients with delirium due to acute respiratory failure or shock<br/>
- Intervention: Haloperidol (max 20 mg/day), ziprasidone (max 40 mg/day), or placebo<br/>
- Primary endpoint: Days alive without delirium or coma during 14-day intervention period<br/>
- Secondary endpoints: 30-day and 90-day survival, time to freedom from mechanical ventilation, and time to ICU/hospital discharge<br/>
- Safety endpoints: Extrapyramidal symptoms and excessive sedation<br/>
<br/>
#### Population<br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: ICU patients ≥18 years old with acute respiratory failure or shock and delirium<br/>
- Exclusion Criteria: Severe cognitive impairment, high risk for medication side effects, contraindications to study drugs, various other medical exclusions<br/>
<br/>
#### Interventions<br/>
- Patients received IV boluses of haloperidol, ziprasidone, or placebo with doses adjusted based on delirium status and side effects<br/>
- Median exposure: 4 days<br/>
- Co-intervention adherence to the ABCDE bundle was above 88% for all trial groups.<br/>
<br/>
#### Outcomes<br/>
- Primary: The median number of days alive without delirium was similar between groups: 8.5 (Placebo), 7.9 (Haloperidol), 8.7 (Ziprasidone) (P=0.26 for overall effect across trial groups)<br/>
- Secondary: No significant differences between groups concerning survival or lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital<br/>
- Safety: More corrected QT prolongation in ziprasidone group; two cases of torsades de pointes in haloperidol group; no significant difference in other side effects across groups<br/>
<br/>
#### Criticisms<br/>
- Trial may not have been adequately powered to detect an effect size of less than 2 days difference in primary outcome<br/>
- The effect of higher doses of haloperidol or other antipsychotic medications was not evaluated<br/>
- Majority of patients had hypoactive delirium; thus, limited conclusions can be drawn regarding hyperactive delirium<br/>
- Excluded certain patient groups that might benefit from antipsychotic treatment, such as those with alcohol withdrawal<br/>
<br/>
#### Funding<br/>
Supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center.<br/>
