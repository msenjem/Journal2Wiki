 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic therapy reduce the risk of sudden death among patients with coronary artery disease, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 percent or less, and asymptomatic unsustained ventricular tachycardia?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic therapy with implantable defibrillators, but not with antiarrhythmic drugs, reduces the risk of sudden death in high-risk patients with coronary disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and spontaneous unsustained ventricular tachycardia have a significant risk of sudden death. This study aimed to evaluate if an electrophysiologically guided therapy approach could reduce this risk.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Research findings suggested implanting defibrillators (but not the use of antiarrhythmic-drug therapy based on electrophysiologic testing) in patients like those within the trial criteria to provide beneficial outcomes. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Randomized, controlled trial with an enrollment period from 1990 to 1996.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A total of 704 patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤40%, and spontaneous unsustained ventricular tachycardia.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
Patients with coronary artery disease, a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%, asymptomatic unsustained ventricular tachycardia, and sustained tachyarrhythmia induced by programmed stimulation.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
History of syncope or sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation occurring more than 48 hours after myocardial infarction.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
Similar across both treatment and placebo groups. Patients had a median ejection fraction of around 29-30%.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to receive electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic therapy or no therapy. Antiarrhythmic therapy included drugs and/or implantable defibrillators as indicated by electrophysiologic testing.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
Cardiac arrest or death from arrhythmia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Overall mortality, death from cardiac causes, and the incidence of spontaneous, sustained ventricular tachycardia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and multiple pharmaceutical and medical device companies.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The full text of this study provides detailed insights into the methodology, results, and implications of the study findings.
