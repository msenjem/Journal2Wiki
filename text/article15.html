 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">For patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI with stent placement, rivaroxaban in combination with a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months, or in combination with very-low-dose rivaroxaban plus DAPT for 1, 6, or 12 months, resulted in a lower rate of clinically significant bleeding compared to standard therapy with a vitamin K antagonist plus DAPT.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In atrial fibrillation patients who underwent PCI with stenting, treatment with low-dose or very-low-dose rivaroxaban in combination with antiplatelet agents showed a lower risk of bleeding events than traditional therapy with a vitamin K antagonist and DAPT. Efficacy for major cardiovascular events was similar among the groups, although confidence intervals were broad, limiting definite conclusions regarding efficacy.

- N=2,124 patients
- Group 1 (n=709): Low-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) plus P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months
- Group 2 (n=709): Very-low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus DAPT for prespecified duration (1, 6, or 12 months)
- Group 3 (n=706): Standard therapy with vitamin K antagonist once daily plus DAPT for prespecified duration (1, 6, or 12 months)
- Enrollment: May 2013 to July 2015
- Mean follow-up: 12 months
- Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Clinically significant bleeding

- Clinically significant bleeding was lower in groups receiving rivaroxaban than in standard therapy group (16.8% in Group 1, 18.0% in Group 2, 26.7% in Group 3)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Rates of major adverse cardiovascular events were similar across all groups

- Certain rivaroxaban doses not approved for management of acute coronary syndrome or atrial fibrillation
