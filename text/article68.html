### Clinical Question<br/>
In patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, is PCI with everolimus-eluting stents noninferior to CABG in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events?<br/>
<br/>
### Bottom Line<br/>
In patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, PCI with everolimus-eluting stents was not noninferior to CABG with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events at 2 years. Over longer-term follow-up, CABG has a lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular events compared to PCI.<br/>
<br/>
### Major Points<br/><br/>
<br/>
### Guidelines<br/>
Current clinical guidelines recommend CABG as the preferred revascularization strategy for patients with complex coronary lesions and without excessive operative risk.<br/>
<br/>
### Design<br/>
- Multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial<br/>
- N=880 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease<br/>
- PCI with everolimus-eluting stents (n=438) vs. CABG (n=442)<br/>
- Setting: 27 centers in East Asia<br/>
- Enrollment: 2008-2013<br/>
- Median follow-up: 4.6 years<br/>
- Primary outcome: composite of death, myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization<br/>
<br/>
### Population<br/>
- Age â‰¥18 years<br/>
- Angiographically confirmed multivessel coronary artery disease suitable for PCI or CABG<br/>
- Excluded if had significant left main coronary artery disease<br/>
<br/>
### Interventions<br/>
- PCI with everolimus-eluting stents<br/>
- CABG with preference for using the internal thoracic artery for revascularization of the left anterior descending coronary artery<br/>
<br/>
### Outcomes<br/>
#### Primary Outcomes<br/>
- At 2 years: primary end point occurred in 11.0% of PCI group and 7.9% of CABG group (absolute risk difference, 3.1 percentage points; P=0.32 for noninferiority)<br/>
- At median 4.6 years follow-up: primary end point occurred in 15.3% of PCI group and 10.6% of CABG group (hazard ratio, 1.47; P=0.04)<br/>
<br/>
#### Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any repeat revascularization was higher after PCI than after CABG (19.9% vs. 13.3%; P=0.01)<br/>
- No significant difference in composite safety end point of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke<br/>
- Higher rates of any repeat revascularization and spontaneous myocardial infarction after PCI<br/>
- Stent thrombosis occurred in 1.6% of patients within the PCI group<br/>
<br/>
### Criticisms<br/>
- Early termination of the trial might have reduced the statistical power.<br/>
- Crossovers from CABG to PCI may have introduced a bias.<br/>
- Results from the subgroup analyses should be considered exploratory due to restrictions in sample size.<br/>
- Use of some medications varied significantly between groups.<br/>
- Includes only patients of Asian race which could affect generalizability.<br/>
<br/>
### Funding<br/>
The trial was supported by the CardioVascular Research Foundation, Abbott Vascular, and a grant from Korea Healthcare Technology R&amp;D Project, Ministry for Health and Welfare Affairs, South Korea.<br/>
