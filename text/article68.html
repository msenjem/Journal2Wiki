 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, PCI with everolimus-eluting stents was not noninferior to CABG with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events at 2 years. Over longer-term follow-up, CABG has a lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular events compared to PCI.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The BEST trial aimed to compare the outcomes of multivessel coronary artery disease treated with PCI using everolimus-eluting stents versus CABG. The trial found that after a median of 4.6 years of follow-up, the rate of major cardiovascular events was higher in the PCI group than in the CABG group. This difference was mainly due to a higher rate of target-vessel revascularization in the PCI group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current clinical guidelines recommend CABG as the preferred revascularization strategy for patients with complex coronary lesions and without excessive operative risk.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial
- N=880 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease
- PCI with everolimus-eluting stents (n=438) vs. CABG (n=442)
- Setting: 27 centers in East Asia
- Enrollment: 2008-2013
- Median follow-up: 4.6 years
- Primary outcome: composite of death, myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Age â‰¥18 years
- Angiographically confirmed multivessel coronary artery disease suitable for PCI or CABG
- Excluded if had significant left main coronary artery disease
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- PCI with everolimus-eluting stents
- CABG with preference for using the internal thoracic artery for revascularization of the left anterior descending coronary artery
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">#### Primary Outcomes
- At 2 years: primary end point occurred in 11.0% of PCI group and 7.9% of CABG group (absolute risk difference, 3.1 percentage points; P=0.32 for noninferiority)
- At median 4.6 years follow-up: primary end point occurred in 15.3% of PCI group and 10.6% of CABG group (hazard ratio, 1.47; P=0.04)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any repeat revascularization was higher after PCI than after CABG (19.9% vs. 13.3%; P=0.01)
- No significant difference in composite safety end point of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke
- Higher rates of any repeat revascularization and spontaneous myocardial infarction after PCI
- Stent thrombosis occurred in 1.6% of patients within the PCI group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Early termination of the trial might have reduced the statistical power.
- Crossovers from CABG to PCI may have introduced a bias.
- Results from the subgroup analyses should be considered exploratory due to restrictions in sample size.
- Use of some medications varied significantly between groups.
- Includes only patients of Asian race which could affect generalizability.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was supported by the CardioVascular Research Foundation, Abbott Vascular, and a grant from Korea Healthcare Technology R&D Project, Ministry for Health and Welfare Affairs, South Korea.
