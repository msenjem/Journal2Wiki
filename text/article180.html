- Clinical Question<br/>
Does the use of dexmedetomidine as the primary sedative agent in mechanically ventilated ICU patients reduce mortality rates compared to usual sedation care?<br/>
<br/>
- Bottom Line<br/>
Early use of dexmedetomidine as the primary sedative in mechanically ventilated ICU patients did not result in a lower 90-day mortality compared to other sedatives and was associated with more adverse events.<br/>
<br/>
- Major Points<br/><br/>
<br/>
- Guidelines<br/>
Not available.<br/>
<br/>
- Design<br/>
Open-label, randomized, controlled trial.<br/>
N=4000 mechanically ventilated ICU patients.<br/>
Intervention: Dexmedetomidine as sole/primary sedative (n=2001).<br/>
Control: Usual sedation care - propofol, midazolam, or other sedatives (n=1999).<br/>
Setting: 74 ICUs in eight countries.<br/>
Enrollment: 2013-2018.<br/>
Mean follow-up: 90 days.<br/>
Primary outcome: Death from any cause at 90 days.<br/>
<br/>
- Population<br/>
Inclusion Criteria: Adults in ICU, requiring mechanical ventilation for more than the next calendar day, receiving sedatives for safety and comfort.<br/>
Exclusion Criteria: Age &lt;18 years, mechanical ventilation for over 12 hours before enrollment, suspected/confirmed acute primary brain injury.<br/>
Median age: 63.7 years.<br/>
<br/>
- Interventions<br/>
Dexmedetomidine aiming to be the primary sedative, supplemented with propofol, midazolam, or both when required.<br/>
Usual care consisting of propofol, midazolam, or other sedatives, excluding dexmedetomidine.<br/>
<br/>
- Outcomes<br/>
Primary Outcome: At 90 days, death from any cause occurred in 29.1% of both dexmedetomidine and usual-care groups (adjusted risk difference, 0.0 percentage points).<br/>
Secondary Outcomes: No significant differences in 180-day mortality, institution dependency at 180 days, cognitive function, health-related quality of life, days free from coma/delirium, or ventilator-free days at day 28.<br/>
Additional Findings: Dexmedetomidine group required additional sedatives to maintain target sedation, more target sedation scores achieved in the dexmedetomidine group, deep sedation for clinical reasons frequent in both groups.<br/>
<br/>
- Criticisms<br/>
The trial was open-label, and the use of supplemental sedation might have affected sedation levels and outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
- Funding<br/>
Supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, Health Research Council of New Zealand, National Heart Institute Foundation of Malaysia. Pfizer and Orion Pharma provided dexmedetomidine.<br/>
