 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, does intensive blood pressure control to a systolic blood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared to a standard target of less than 140 mm Hg?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In high-risk patients without diabetes, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as opposed to less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) compared the effects of two systolic blood pressure targets, less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) and less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment), on cardiovascular outcomes in patients without diabetes. Intensive treatment was associated with a 25% reduction in the primary composite outcome of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes, and 27% reduction in all-cause mortality, though with a higher rate of some adverse events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">SPRINT results suggest that patients at high risk for cardiovascular events may benefit from a systolic blood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg. These results may influence guidelines, particularly for the treatment of older patients with hypertension.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">SPRINT was a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial that enrolled 9,361 patients aged 50 or older with systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher and a high cardiovascular risk but without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Age â‰¥50 years, systolic blood pressure of 130 to 180 mm Hg, and increased cardiovascular risk defined by various criteria.
Exclusion Criteria: Diabetes mellitus or prior stroke.
Baseline Characteristics: Average age was 68 years, and 28% of participants were 75 years of age or older. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">After randomization, participants' baseline antihypertensive regimens were adjusted to meet their assigned blood pressure targets, with regular follow-ups and lifestyle modifications encouraged.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes: The primary composite outcome was the occurrence of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes.
Secondary Outcomes: Individual components of the primary composite outcome, death from any cause, and progression of renal disease were also assessed.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The lack of generalizability to populations not included in the study, such as persons with diabetes, those with prior stroke, and those younger than 50 years of age, is a limitation. Also noted were increased adverse events in intensive-treatment group including hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by contracts from the NIH, including NHLBI, NIDDK, NIA, and NINDS. Takeda Pharmaceuticals International and Arbor Pharmaceuticals donated medications for the trial.
