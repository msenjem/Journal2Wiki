 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among patients with recent myocardial infarction and an ejection fraction of 35% or less, does a wearable cardioverter–defibrillator reduce the incidence of sudden death during the high-risk period before an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and an ejection fraction of 35% or less, the wearable cardioverter–defibrillator did not significantly reduce the primary outcome of arrhythmic death compared with guideline-directed medical therapy alone during the first 90 days post-infarction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have been shown to reduce mortality when implanted months to years after myocardial infarction. However, ICDs are not recommended until 40 to 90 days post-infarction. The Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death Trial (VEST) aimed to determine whether a wearable cardioverter–defibrillator could protect against sudden death during this vulnerable period.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last knowledge update for this summary, there were no specific guideline recommendations reflecting the trial's results regarding the wearable cardioverter–defibrillator post-myocardial infarction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">2302 participants with acute myocardial infarction and an ejection fraction of 35% or less.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Hospitalized with an acute myocardial infarction
- Ejection fraction of 35% or less assessed ≥8 hours after myocardial infarction or ≥48 hours after coronary-artery bypass grafting
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Implanted cardioverter–defibrillator or unipolar pacemaker
- Significant valve disease, long-term hemodialysis, inappropriate chest circumference for the device, pregnancy, or extended nursing facility stay
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Mean ejection fraction: 28%
- Majority underwent PCI during index_gpt hospitalization
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Participants randomized 2:1 to wearable cardioverter–defibrillator plus guideline-directed therapy or guideline-directed therapy alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Composite of sudden death or death from ventricular tachyarrhythmia at 90 days (arrhythmic death)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Death from any cause
- Nonarrhythmic death
- Hospitalization for various cardiac conditions
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Misclassification of the adjudicated cause of death may have reduced power for the primary outcome.
- Device adherence less than anticipated, potentially diminishing the power to show the wearable cardioverter–defibrillator's effectiveness.
- Primary endpoint was changed from all-cause mortality at 60 days to arrhythmic death at 90 days.
- Continued funding by device manufacturer could introduce potential bias.
