<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In patients at high cardiovascular risk but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, does a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or mixed nuts reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular events?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Among high-risk patients, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or mixed nuts resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events, supporting its use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current findings support the benefits of the Mediterranean diet in reducing cardiovascular risk and are in line with dietary recommendations promoting its adoption for overall health improvement.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial<br/>
- N=7,447 participants at high cardiovascular risk<br/>
- Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat)<br/>
- Median follow-up: 4.8 years<br/>
- The trial was stopped early due to the demonstrated benefits of the Mediterranean diet<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- High-risk individuals aged 55 to 80 years without cardiovascular disease<br/>
- Inclusion criteria: Type 2 diabetes mellitus or ≥3 major risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, elevated LDL cholesterol, etc.<br/>
- Baseline characteristics: balanced across the three study groups<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (~1 liter/week)<br/>
- Mediterranean diet with mixed nuts (30g/day)<br/>
- Control diet with advice to reduce dietary fat<br/>
- All groups received quarterly educational sessions; the Mediterranean groups received supplemental foods, and the control group received small nonfood gifts<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
- Rate of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes): <br/>
  - Group with extra-virgin olive oil: 3.8%, HR 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.91)<br/>
  - Group with mixed nuts: 3.4%, HR 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94)<br/>
  - Control group: 4.4%<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Stroke, myocardial infarction individually, death from cardiovascular causes, and death from any cause<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Findings mostly reflect the benefits of supplemental foods (olive oil, nuts)<br/>
- Dropout rates were higher in the control group<br/>
- Study's generalizability might be limited to high-risk Mediterranean populations<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
Supported by the Spanish government's Instituto de Salud Carlos III and others; food donors included extra-virgin olive oil and nut producers. The sponsors had no role in the trial design, data analysis, or reporting.<br/>
