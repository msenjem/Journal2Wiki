 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">For patients with atrioventricular block, mild-to-moderate heart failure, and abnormal left ventricular systolic function, biventricular pacing was found to be superior to right ventricular apical pacing in preventing death, heart failure visits requiring intravenous therapy, or significant increases in left ventricular end-systolic volume index_gpt.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prior studies, such as MOST and DAVID, have highlighted potential adverse outcomes associated with right ventricular pacing, including hospitalization for heart failure. This has led to the hypothesis that biventricular pacing, as used in CRT, may be a better alternative. BLOCK HF sought to compare these two pacing strategies in patients with established needs for ventricular pacing and accompanying left ventricular dysfunction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not explicitly recommend biventricular pacing over standard right ventricular pacing for this specific patient population; however, this trial provides evidence that may influence future recommendations.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">918 patients enrolled with a successful device implantation attempted in 809 patients and successful in 758 (93.7%). Randomization occurred for 691 patients.
Inclusion Criteria:
- Atrioventricular block requiring pacing
- NYHA class I, II, or III heart failure
- Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤50%
Exclusion Criteria:
- Previous cardiac implantable electrical device
- Unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, or recent coronary intervention
- Valvular disease requiring surgery
- Indication for CRT based on guidelines
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients received cardiac-resynchronization pacemakers or ICDs and were randomized to either standard right ventricular pacing or biventricular pacing.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome:
- Time to death from any cause, urgent care visit for heart failure requiring intravenous therapy, or a ≥15% increase in left ventricular end-systolic volume index_gpt.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Combined outcome of death from any cause or urgent care visit for heart failure.
- Combined outcome of death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure.
- Separate outcomes of death from any cause and hospitalization for heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- A large number of patients switched from right ventricular pacing to biventricular pacing, which could have skewed the results, potentially in favor of right ventricular pacing.
- A fair number of missing echocardiograms resulted in the censoring and exclusion of some patient data from the analysis of the primary outcome.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by Medtronic.
