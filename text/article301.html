<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does early integration of palliative care with standard oncologic care improve quality of life, mood, survival, and end-of-life care among patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Early palliative care led to significant improvements in both quality of life and mood among patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer. Compared to patients receiving standard oncologic care, those receiving early palliative care had less aggressive care at the end of life and longer survival.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer is a debilitating disease which results in high symptom burden and poor quality of life, with a survival prognosis less than one year. This study demonstrates the beneficial impact of introducing palliative care early in the disease continuum, significantly improving patient quality of life, mood, and survival.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
This trial's results encourage early integration of palliative care in the management of patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer, altering previous models which introduced palliative care late in the course of the disease.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Nonblinded, randomized, controlled trial with two groups:<br/>
1. Early palliative care integrated with standard oncologic care.<br/>
2. Standard oncologic care alone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Adult patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer enrolled within 8 weeks after diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
- Pathologically confirmed metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer<br/>
- Performance status 0, 1, or 2<br/>
- Able to read and respond to questions in English<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
- Already receiving palliative care<br/>
- Unable to provide informed consent<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
No significant differences in demographic characteristics or known prognostic factors between the two groups. Baseline quality of life and mood symptoms were also well-matched.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
1. Early palliative care group: initial visit within 3 weeks after enrollment and at least monthly outpatient visits thereafter.<br/>
2. Standard care group: standard oncologic care without scheduled palliative care visits unless requested.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
- Change in quality of life from baseline to 12 weeks, measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Lung (FACT-L) scale.<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Mood, assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9.<br/>
- Survival, aggressive end-of-life care, and documentation of resuscitation preferences.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Single-site study limiting generalizability<br/>
- Lack of diversity in the patient population<br/>
- Potential influences of non-specific care aspects<br/>
- Open-label design<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
Funded by an American Society of Clinical Oncology Career Development Award and philanthropic gifts from the Joanne Hill Monahan Cancer Fund and Golf Fights Cancer.<br/>
