 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, early application of HFOV does not improve, and may increase, in-hospital mortality compared to a conventional ventilation strategy of low tidal volume and high PEEP.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Previous trials hypothesized that HFOV, which uses very small tidal volumes at high rates, could improve survival among adults with ARDS by reducing ventilator-associated lung injury. These trials had limitations due to small sample sizes and outdated comparator strategies. The OSCILLATE trial, conducted at 39 ICUs in five countries, enrolled 548 patients and found that HFOV, as compared with conventional ventilation strategy, was associated with higher in-hospital mortality.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Guidelines at the time of study publication did not explicitly address the early use of HFOV in patients with ARDS.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N=548 adults with new-onset, moderate-to-severe ARDS
- Intervention: HFOV (n=275)
- Control: Conventional ventilation with low tidal volumes and high PEEP (n=273)
- Primary outcome: Rate of in-hospital death from any cause
- Randomization stopped early on the recommendation of the data monitoring committee
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adult patients with new-onset, moderate-to-severe ARDS
- Inclusion criteria: Onset of pulmonary symptoms within past 2 weeks, intubation, hypoxemia, and bilateral air-space opacities on chest radiography
- Exclusion criteria included patients at risk for intracranial hypertension and other conditions limiting the duration of mechanical ventilation
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- HFOV group received median of 3 days of HFOV.
- Control group received conventional ventilation with the use of low tidal volumes and high PEEP.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- In-hospital mortality: 47% in the HFOV group, 35% in the control group (relative risk of death with HFOV, 1.33; P=0.005).
- Patients in HFOV group received higher doses of midazolam and more frequent use of neuromuscular blockers and vasoactive drugs.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Trial stopped early, which may overestimate the effect size.
- Alternative HFOV protocols that use different mean airway pressures or oscillatory frequencies were not tested.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center.
- CareFusion loaned HFOV ventilators and provided technical support but had no role in other aspects of the trial.
