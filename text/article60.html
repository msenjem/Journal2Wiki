 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In high-risk patients with dysglycemia, does daily supplementation with n-3 fatty acids reduce the rate of cardiovascular events?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Daily supplementation with 1 g of n-3 fatty acids did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with dysglycemia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with type 2 diabetes or at high risk for diabetes are at an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Previous studies have suggested that n-3 fatty acids may have cardiovascular benefits, but evidence in patients with dysglycemia has been limited.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time of the study publication, the usage of n-3 fatty acids for the reduction of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with dysglycemia was not established in guidelines.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=12,536
- Interventions: 1 g capsule of at least 900 mg (90% or more) ethyl esters of n-3 fatty acids (n=6,281) or placebo (n=6,255)
- Median follow-up: 6.2 years
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Patients ≥50 years old with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events
- Exclusion Criteria: Unwillingness to discontinue non-study n-3 supplements, HbA1c ≥9%, recent CABG without subsequent cardiovascular event, severe heart failure, active cancer affecting survival
- Baseline Characteristics: Mean age 64 years, 65% men, 59% had previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascularization
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- 1 g capsule of n-3 fatty acids daily containing 465 mg of EPA and 375 mg of DHA
- Placebo capsule containing approximately 1 g of olive oil
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Death from cardiovascular causes: 9.1% in n-3 fatty acids group vs. 9.3% in placebo group (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.10; P=0.72)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Major vascular events: 16.5% vs. 16.3% (HR 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.10; P=0.81)
- Death from any cause: 15.1% vs. 15.4% (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.07; P=0.63)
- Death from arrhythmia: 4.6% vs. 4.1% (HR 1.10; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.30; P=0.26)
- Triglyceride levels reduced by 14.5 mg per deciliter more in n-3 fatty acids group (P<0.001)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The daily dose of n-3 fatty acids may have been too low to demonstrate a benefit.
- Assessment of the effect of n–3 fatty acids based on dietary intake was conducted through a questionnaire rather than serum level measurement.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by Sanofi, with study drugs provided by Pronova BioPharma Norge.
