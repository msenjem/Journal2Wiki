 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with recent acute coronary syndrome and LDL cholesterol levels within guideline recommendations, the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy resulted in incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol and a further reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events without significant safety concerns.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The IMPROVE-IT trial demonstrated that ezetimibe, when added to statin therapy in stable patients post-acute coronary syndrome, provided additional lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and translated to a modest but statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events. This trial supported the notion of 'lower is better' for LDL cholesterol levels and highlighted the benefits of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in this patient population. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time of patient enrollment, guidelines recommended LDL cholesterol levels of less than 70 mg per deciliter for patients post-acute coronary syndrome. These current findings suggest additional benefits with even lower LDL cholesterol levels.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Double-blind, randomized control trial with median follow-up of 6 years.
Population
18,144 patients, ≥50 years old, hospitalized within preceeding 10 days for acute coronary syndrome and with LDL cholesterol levels of 50-125 mg per deciliter (or 50-100 mg per deciliter if already on lipid-lowering therapy).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Simvastatin (40 mg) + Ezetimibe (10 mg) [simvastatin–ezetimibe group]
- Simvastatin (40 mg) + Placebo [simvastatin-monotherapy group]
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome:
- Composite of cardiovascular death, major coronary event, or nonfatal stroke
Secondary Outcomes:
- Composite of death from any cause, major coronary event, or nonfatal stroke
- Composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or urgent coronary revascularization ≥30 days after randomization
- Composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, all revascularization ≥30 days after randomization, or nonfatal stroke
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Study only included patients with acute coronary syndrome; results are most applicable to this population.
- Study statin regimen may not represent contemporary high-intensity statin therapy, as only simvastatin 40 mg and 80 mg were used.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Merck (the sponsor and manufacturer of ezetimibe).
