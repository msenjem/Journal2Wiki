 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Transcatheter mitral-valve repair plus medical therapy was superior to medical therapy alone in reducing hospitalizations for heart failure and all-cause mortality within 24 months in patients with heart failure and significant secondary mitral regurgitation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with heart failure and secondary mitral regurgitation who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy have few treatment options and a poor prognosis. Transcatheter mitral-valve repair may reduce heart failure symptoms and potentially improve survival for these patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">No guidelines were specified within the study. The treatment modalities were chosen according to standard medical guidelines for heart failure therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-label trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Enrolled 614 patients at 78 centers in the United States and Canada with heart failure and secondary mitral regurgitation.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 50%
- Moderate-to-severe or severe secondary mitral regurgitation
- Symptomatic (NYHA class II, III, or IVa) despite maximal doses of guideline-directed medical therapy
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
The specific exclusion criteria were not disclosed in the summary.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age: 72.2 ± 11.2 years
- 36.0% women
- 36.5% received cardiac resynchronization therapy
- Mitral regurgitation grade 3+ in 52.2% and 4+ in 47.8%
- Mean STS score: 8.2 ± 5.9%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to receive either transcatheter mitral-valve repair plus medical therapy (device group) or medical therapy alone (control group).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Effectiveness
- Hospitalizations for heart failure within 24 months
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Safety
- Freedom from device-related complications at 12 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- All-cause mortality within 24 months
- Quality of life and functional capacity within 24 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was open-label, with potential for bias in intervention awareness. Longer median follow-up in the device group, possibly due to lower mortality. By chance, a higher use of agents affecting the renin–angiotensin axis was noted in the device group at baseline.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by Abbott.
