<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) improve survival in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not suitable candidates for surgery?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not suitable candidates for surgery, TAVI compared with standard therapy significantly reduced rates of death from any cause, repeat hospitalization, and cardiac symptoms, despite a higher incidence of major strokes and vascular events.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
For patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement, TAVI is a potential life-saving option. The PARTNER trial compared TAVI with standard therapy and found that TAVI significantly reduced one-year mortality (30.7% vs. 50.7%) and rates of hospitalization without an increased risk of early mortality when compared to standard therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of the latest update from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, TAVI is a class I recommendation for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis who are not surgical candidates, providing a heart team agrees on the treatment and life expectancy is greater than 12 months. <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial<br/>
- N=358 patients with severe aortic stenosis and inoperable condition<br/>
- TAVI (n=179) vs. standard therapy (n=179)<br/>
- Setting: 21 centers (17 in the USA)<br/>
- Enrollment: 2007-2009<br/>
- Mean follow-up: 1.6 years (minimum follow-up 1 year, maximum 2.8 years)<br/>
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat<br/>
- Primary Outcomes: Death from any cause<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Patients with severe aortic stenosis and symptoms, in whom surgeons deemed surgery as high-risk or contraindicated<br/>
- Exclusion Criteria: Bicuspid or noncalcified aortic valve, MI within prior 7 days, need for bypass grafting, LVEF &lt;20%, aortic annulus diameter &lt;18mm or &gt;25mm, significant aortic regurgitation, among others<br/>
- Baseline Characteristics: Similar between groups, high-risk population with an STS score of 11.6±6.0%<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- TAVI via transfemoral route with the Edwards SAPIEN heart-valve system<br/>
- Standard therapy included balloon aortic valvuloplasty as per usual care<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcome: One-year mortality was significantly lower in the TAVI group compared to standard therapy (30.7% vs. 50.7%, HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40-0.74, P&lt;0.001)<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes: At one year, TAVI reduced the composite endpoint of death from any cause or repeat hospitalization (42.5% vs. 71.6%, HR 0.46, P&lt;0.001), despite a higher incidence of major strokes (7.8% vs. 3.9%, not statistically significant) and major vascular complications in the TAVI group<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- High surgical risk patients may not represent broader aortic stenosis population<br/>
- Increased stroke rate in TAVI group raises concern<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The PARTNER trial was funded by Edwards Lifesciences.<br/>
