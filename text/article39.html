 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early rhythm-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation diagnosed ≤1 year before and with cardiovascular conditions reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared to usual care, without significantly affecting the number of nights spent in the hospital.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Previous trials did not show the superiority of rhythm control over rate control in patients with established atrial fibrillation. The Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4) investigated whether an early rhythm-control strategy that includes ablation would improve outcomes compared to usual care in patients with early-onset AF and additional CV conditions.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Modern guidelines do not specify the timing of rhythm vs. rate control initiation in the management of AF patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- International, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomized, open, blinded-outcome-assessment trial
- N=2,789 patients with recent AF (median time since diagnosis, 36 days) and CV conditions
- Interventions: Early rhythm control vs. usual care
- Setting: 135 centers across 11 European countries
- Enrollment: 2011-2016
- Follow-up: Median 5.1 years per patient
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcomes: Death from CV causes, stroke, hospitalization for worsening heart failure or acute coronary syndrome. Secondary outcomes included the number of nights in the hospital per year.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Adults (≥18 years) with AF diagnosed ≤12 months before enrollment
- Patients also had either age >75 years, prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, or two additional risk factors (e.g., age >65 years, female sex, CHF, etc.)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Not specified in the summary
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics:
- Mean age: 70 years, 46% female, median time since AF diagnosis 36 days
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Early rhythm control: Treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs or AF ablation; cardioversion for persistent AF initiated after randomization
- Usual care: Rate-control therapy; rhythm control for AF-related symptom management
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- First primary outcome event occurred less frequently in early rhythm control than usual care (hazard ratio, 0.79; 96% CI, 0.66 to 0.94; P=0.005)
- The number of nights in the hospital was not significantly different (P=0.23)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open trial design, which may introduce bias despite blinded outcome assessment
- Not designed to assess specific components of rhythm-control therapy
- Results may not generalize to patients with later initiation of rhythm-control therapy
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by various institutions including the German Ministry of Education and Research, German Center for Cardiovascular Research, and European Heart Rhythm Association, among others.
