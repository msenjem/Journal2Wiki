 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Vemurafenib significantly improved rates of overall and progression-free survival compared with dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma harboring the BRAF V600E mutation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with metastatic melanoma have historically had a poor prognosis. Vemurafenib, a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF, was evaluated for its therapeutic impact in patients with the BRAF V600E mutation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff for this summary, formal guidelines incorporating vemurafenib's comparative efficacy for the stated patient population have not been specified.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, phase 3, randomized, open-label trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- 675 patients with previously untreated, unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma that tested positive for the BRAF V600E mutation.
- Inclusion criteria: ≥18 years, ECOG 0 or 1 performance status, sufficient organ function.
- Exclusion criteria: Prior cancer within five years, CNS metastases, and other anticancer therapy concurrent use.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or 
- Dacarbazine (1000 mg/m² intravenously every 3 weeks).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcomes: Rates of overall survival and progression-free survival.
- Secondary outcomes: Confirmed response rate and duration of response.
- Key results: Vemurafenib had a 63% relative reduction in the risk of death and a 74% reduction in the risk of death or disease progression compared to dacarbazine.
- Response rates were 48% for vemurafenib and 5% for dacarbazine.
- Median follow-up: 3.8 months for vemurafenib and 2.3 months for dacarbazine groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Overall survival beyond 7 months in either group was not adequately reported due to insufficient follow-up time.
- The trial was open-label and not placebo-controlled.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Hoffmann–La Roche.
