This landmark randomized controlled trial established that enalapril significantly improved both survival and clinical symptoms in patients with severe heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Modern guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors as part of standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

- N=253 patients with NYHA class IV heart failure
- Enalapril (n=127)
- Placebo (n=126)
- Follow-up averaged 188 days, up to 20 months
- Primary endpoint: Crude mortality at six months
- Secondary endpoints: 12-month and overall mortality during the entire trial period

 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class IV)
- History of heart disease with symptoms of dyspnea or fatigue or both, along with signs of fluid retention and no evidence of primary pulmonary disease
- Enlarged heart size radiologically (more than 600 ml/m² in men or more than 550 ml/m² in women)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Acute pulmonary edema, significant valve stenosis, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, planned cardiac surgery, right heart failure due to pulmonary disease, serum creatinine above 300 μmol/L
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Similar clinical characteristics between enalapril and placebo groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Enalapril or placebo started with a dose of 5 mg twice a day in the hospital, increased to 10 mg twice daily after one week as tolerated, and further increased up to 20 mg twice a day
- Protocol adjusted for high-risk patients to start at 2.5 mg daily
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Six-month mortality was 26% in the enalapril group vs. 44% in the placebo group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Mortality at one year and end of the study was reduced by 31% and 27%, respectively, with enalapril
- Sudden cardiac death incidence was similar between groups
- Deaths from progression of heart failure reduced by 50% in enalapril group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- The trial's dosage and administration adjustments may not reflect current practice
- The study did not provide long-term data on the duration of the beneficial effect or its effects in less severe forms of heart failure
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Supported by a grant from Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories
