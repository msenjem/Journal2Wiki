 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In ambulatory patients with cancer at intermediate-to-high risk for venous thromboembolism who are starting chemotherapy, does thromboprophylaxis with apixaban reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism compared with placebo?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Apixaban significantly reduced the incidence of venous thromboembolism in ambulatory patients with cancer at intermediate-to-high risk who were starting chemotherapy, at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding episodes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with active cancer have an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The AVERT trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of using apixaban, an oral anticoagulant, for thromboprophylaxis in this patient population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of this trial's publication, guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients were not established based on the findings of this study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial
N=574 patients
Randomized 1:1 to receive apixaban or placebo
Treatment period: 180 days
Median follow-up: 183 days
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
-Newly diagnosed cancer or progression after remission
-Initiating new chemotherapy course
-Khorana score ≥2
-Age ≥18 years
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
-Risk factors for significant bleeding
-Hepatic disease with coagulopathy
-Certain cancer diagnoses (basal-cell/squamous-cell skin cancer, acute leukemia, or myeloproliferative neoplasm)
-Planned stem-cell transplantation
-Life expectancy <6 months
-Renal insufficiency, platelet count <50,000 per cubic millimeter
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
-Mean age 61 years
-58.2% women
-Most common cancers: gynecologic (25.8%), lymphoma (25.3%), and pancreatic (13.6%)
-22.8% were using antiplatelet or NSAIDs
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">-Apixaban: 2.5 mg twice daily
-Placebo: identical tablets twice daily
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
-Venous thromboembolism: 4.2% in apixaban group vs. 10.2% in placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.65; P<0.001)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">-Major bleeding: 3.5% in apixaban group vs. 1.8% in placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.95; P=0.046)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">-Limited ability to make definitive conclusions about individual tumor types or chemotherapy regimens based on sample size.
-Results may be less applicable to patients with significant renal dysfunction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Bristol-Myers Squibb–Pfizer Alliance.
