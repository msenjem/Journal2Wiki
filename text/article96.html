 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">For patients with three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease, CABG resulted in lower rates of the combined endpoint of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at one year compared to PCI with drug-eluting stents, and thus should remain the standard treatment for such patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Despite PCI with drug-eluting stents being increasingly used to treat complex coronary artery disease, historical data predominantly supports CABG for patients with three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease. The SYNTAX trial compared PCI and CABG in such patients, finding CABG to be associated with lower rates of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events at one year.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">According to current guidelines, CABG remains the treatment of choice for patients with severe coronary artery disease, including those with left main coronary artery disease and those with three-vessel disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial of 1800 patients. Randomization was 1:1 for CABG vs. PCI with Taxus Express paclitaxel-eluting stents. Mean follow-up 12 months.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with previously untreated three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease were eligible. Cases where equivalent anatomical revascularization with either CABG or PCI was feasible were randomized.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Participants underwent CABG or PCI aiming to achieve complete revascularization. Post-procedure pharmacological treatment choices reflected local practices.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The primary endpoint was a major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event (MACCE) at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included individual components of MACCE, revascularization rates, stent thrombosis, and graft occlusion rates at 12 months.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The 12-month follow-up may not fully reflect the long-term impact of interventions.
- Standard care medication differed between treatment groups.
- More patients withdrew from the CABG group after randomization than from the PCI group.
- The detection of non-severe myocardial infarction might have been missed due to the study's definition.
- Longer-term follow-up is needed to assess sustained effects on cardiac health.
