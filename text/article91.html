 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Moderate-dose celecoxib was noninferior to ibuprofen or naproxen with regard to cardiovascular safety in patients requiring NSAIDs for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and at increased cardiovascular risk.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">PRECISION was a randomized trial assessing the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal safety of celecoxib compared to two nonselective NSAIDs (ibuprofen and naproxen) in patients requiring chronic NSAID therapy for arthritis and at elevated cardiovascular risk. Celecoxib showed noninferiority in terms of cardiovascular safety, meeting all four predefined noninferiority requirements with respect to both naproxen and ibuprofen.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of August 2017, no guidelines have been published that include the results of the PRECISION trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial
- N=24,081 patients
- Celecoxib group (mean daily dose, 209 mg)
- Naproxen group (mean daily dose, 852 mg)
- Ibuprofen group (mean daily dose, 2045 mg)
- Mean follow-up: 34.1 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients 18 years or older requiring daily NSAIDs for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and with established cardiovascular disease or increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Celecoxib (100 mg twice daily), ibuprofen (600 mg three times daily), or naproxen (375 mg twice daily) with matching placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcomes: Composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.
- Secondary Outcomes: Major adverse cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal events, and renal outcomes.
- Tertiary Outcomes: Clinically significant renal events, iron deficiency anemia of gastrointestinal origin, and hospitalization for heart failure or hypertension.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Lower adherence and retention might have influenced the principal conclusions, though similarity in intention-to-treat and on-treatment populations suggests the primary findings were likely unaffected.
- Multiplicity of comparisons without adjustment increases the potential for false positives.
- No insights can be provided regarding over two dozen other marketed NSAIDs, as the results only reflect the relative safety of the three drugs in the trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by Pfizer.
