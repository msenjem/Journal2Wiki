 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit improve the outcomes of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early goal-directed therapy in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock reduced in-hospital mortality compared to standard therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early goal-directed therapy aims to optimize cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. This study assessed the efficacy of implementing early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend early goal-directed therapy as part of the initial management for severe sepsis and septic shock.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Prospective, randomized, controlled trial
- N=263 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock
- Early goal-directed therapy (n=130) vs. Standard therapy (n=133)
- Setting: Urban emergency department
- Enrollment: March 1997 to March 2000
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Adults with severe sepsis, septic shock, or sepsis syndrome presenting to the emergency department
- Two of four criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome met
- Systolic blood pressure ≤90 mm Hg or blood lactate concentration ≥4 mmol per liter
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Age <18, pregnancy, acute cerebral vascular event, acute coronary syndrome, immediate surgical requirement, and other specific conditions
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- No significant differences between the two groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy conducted for at least six hours pre-ICU
- Central venous catheter capable of measuring central venous oxygen saturation was used for early goal-directed therapy
- Standard therapy group received critical-care consultation and care based on clinician discretion
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- In-hospital mortality: 30.5% in early goal-directed therapy vs. 46.5% in standard therapy (P=0.009)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Early goal-directed therapy group had higher central venous oxygen saturation, lower lactate concentration, lower base deficit, and higher pH than standard therapy group (P≤0.02 for all)
- Lower mean APACHE II scores, indicating less severe organ dysfunction, in early goal-directed therapy group (P<0.001)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial may have inherent bias from the influence of investigators on the care provided to the early goal-directed therapy group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by Henry Ford Health Systems Fund for Research, a Weatherby Healthcare Resuscitation Fellowship, equipment from Edwards Lifesciences, and laboratory assays equipment from Nova Biomedical
