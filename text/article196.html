<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit improve the outcomes of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Early goal-directed therapy in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock reduced in-hospital mortality compared to standard therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Early goal-directed therapy aims to optimize cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. This study assessed the efficacy of implementing early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines recommend early goal-directed therapy as part of the initial management for severe sepsis and septic shock.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Prospective, randomized, controlled trial<br/>
- N=263 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock<br/>
- Early goal-directed therapy (n=130) vs. Standard therapy (n=133)<br/>
- Setting: Urban emergency department<br/>
- Enrollment: March 1997 to March 2000<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
- Adults with severe sepsis, septic shock, or sepsis syndrome presenting to the emergency department<br/>
- Two of four criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome met<br/>
- Systolic blood pressure ≤90 mm Hg or blood lactate concentration ≥4 mmol per liter<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
- Age &lt;18, pregnancy, acute cerebral vascular event, acute coronary syndrome, immediate surgical requirement, and other specific conditions<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
- No significant differences between the two groups<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy conducted for at least six hours pre-ICU<br/>
- Central venous catheter capable of measuring central venous oxygen saturation was used for early goal-directed therapy<br/>
- Standard therapy group received critical-care consultation and care based on clinician discretion<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
- In-hospital mortality: 30.5% in early goal-directed therapy vs. 46.5% in standard therapy (P=0.009)<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Early goal-directed therapy group had higher central venous oxygen saturation, lower lactate concentration, lower base deficit, and higher pH than standard therapy group (P≤0.02 for all)<br/>
- Lower mean APACHE II scores, indicating less severe organ dysfunction, in early goal-directed therapy group (P&lt;0.001)<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The trial may have inherent bias from the influence of investigators on the care provided to the early goal-directed therapy group<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
- Funded by Henry Ford Health Systems Fund for Research, a Weatherby Healthcare Resuscitation Fellowship, equipment from Edwards Lifesciences, and laboratory assays equipment from Nova Biomedical<br/>
