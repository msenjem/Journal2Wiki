 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In ICU patients requiring intravascular volume resuscitation, does the choice of resuscitation fluid (albumin or saline) affect survival?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In ICU patients requiring fluid resuscitation, there is no significant difference in 28-day mortality rates between those treated with albumin and those treated with saline.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The SAFE study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial that compared the use of 4% albumin versus normal saline for intravascular fluid resuscitation in a diverse group of ICU patients. The trial found no significant difference in 28-day mortality or in secondary outcomes like mechanical ventilation days and length of ICU stay, suggesting that albumin and saline have similar clinical efficacy for fluid resuscitation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date for this article, specific guidelines considering the results of the SAFE study have not been detailed.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
N=6,997
Albumin group (n=3,497)
Saline group (n=3,500)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: ICU patients 18 years or older requiring fluid administration to maintain or increase intravascular volume.
Exclusion Criteria: Patients admitted post-cardiac surgery, post-liver transplantation, or for treatment of burns.
Baseline Characteristics: Similar baseline characteristics between both groups, including APACHE II scores and organ failure assessment.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to receive either 4% albumin or normal saline for intravascular fluid resuscitation in the 28 days following randomization.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: Death from any cause within 28 days of randomization.
Secondary Outcomes: Duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of renal-replacement therapy, length of ICU and hospital stay, rate of new single-organ, and multiple-organ failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by multiple health boards, departments, councils, and CSL (manufacturers of Albumex).
