    "Partial Oral versus Intravenous Antibiotic Treatment of Endocarditis". The New England Journal of Medicine. 2018. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01375257.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In patients in stable condition with endocarditis on the left side of the heart, is a shift from intravenous to oral antibiotic treatment noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotic treatment in terms of efficacy and safety?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In patients in stable condition with left-sided endocarditis caused by specified pathogens, shifting from intravenous to oral antibiotic treatment was noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotic treatment.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association typically recommend a full course of intravenously administered antibiotic agents for infective endocarditis.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, unblinded, noninferiority trial<br/>
- N=400 adults with left-sided endocarditis<br/>
- Partial oral treatment (n=201)<br/>
- Continued intravenous treatment (n=199)<br/>
- At least 10 days of IV antibiotic treatment were administered to all patients prior to randomization<br/>
- Median follow-up: 6 months after completion of antibiotic treatment<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Adults aged 18 years or older in stable condition<br/>
- Diagnosis: Left-sided endocarditis on native or prosthetic valves<br/>
- Pathogens: streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Patients in the orally treated group were administered two antibiotics from different classes with different antibacterial mechanisms and metabolization processes.<br/>
- Oral antibiotics were supported by pharmacokinetic measurements to ensure adequate dosing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary composite outcome: All-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, clinically evident embolic events, or relapse of bacteremia with the primary pathogen (up to 6 months post-treatment)<br/>
- The primary composite outcome occurred in 12.1% of the intravenously treated group and 9.0% of the orally treated group (P=0.40).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Trial did not include patients with endocarditis caused by pathogens other than the specified four, those with culture-negative endocarditis, or a significant number of intravenous drug users.<br/>
- The generalizability of the findings to settings with higher rates of antibiotic resistance may be limited.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
Supported by unrestricted grants from the Danish Heart Foundation and others.<br/>
