 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prescriptions associated with relatively high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels appear to increase morbidity, while prescriptions emphasizing more efficient removal of urea, given adequate dietary protein and nutrient intake, may decrease morbidity.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) compared morbidity outcomes based on different hemodialysis prescription parameters: high or low BUN concentration and long or short dialysis times. Researchers found a higher morbidity rate, including hospitalizations and medical withdrawals, among groups receiving a dialysis prescription with a relatively high target BUN concentration, regardless of treatment duration.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The findings sparked discussion in the medical community on the adequacy of dialysis prescriptions and influenced subsequent research focusing on dialysis dose parameters. However, current guidelines on this specific issue are not discussed in the article.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized controlled trial
- N=151 patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment
- Randomized to one of four treatment groups based on BUN levels and dialysis times:
  Group I: Long time, low BUN
  Group II: Long time, high BUN
  Group III: Short time, low BUN
  Group IV: Short time, high BUN
- Setting: 8 centers
- Enrollment period not specified
- Follow-up at least three months up to 22 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Aged 18-70 years, undergoing hemodialysis in a center, residual creatinine clearance ≤3 ml/min
- Exclusion Criteria: Known cancer, diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, reversible renal failure, systemic disease like lupus, severe pulmonary or hepatic dysfunction
- Baseline Characteristics: Not discussed in detail
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients received hemodialysis using a prescribed dialyzer and were later randomly assigned to one of the groups.
- Dietary protein intake was prescribed to be between 0.8 to 1.4 g/kg of body weight daily.
- Target BUN concentrations and treatment durations were controlled for using specific hemodialyzers and adjustment of dialysis parameters.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcomes: Major organ-system index_gptes, psychosocial data, and general morbidity measures, including death, hospitalizations, and study withdrawal
- Secondary Outcomes: Not specified
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The physicians and patient-care personnel were not blinded in the study, which could introduce bias in the interpretation of the need for hospitalization and the judgment of patient withdrawal for medical reasons.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported under a contract (NO-l-AM-6–2207) from the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases.
