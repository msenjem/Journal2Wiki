                                        </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does a conservative fluid management strategy improve survival and other outcomes in patients with acute lung injury compared to a liberal fluid management strategy?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A conservative fluid management strategy did not significantly reduce 60-day mortality but improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures compared to a liberal fluid management strategy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT) examined the effects of a conservative versus liberal fluid management strategy on mortality and ventilator-free days in patients with acute lung injury. While no significant difference in 60-day mortality was observed, patients in the conservative-strategy group had better lung function and fewer days on mechanical ventilation and in intensive care.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current evidence does not support a definitive guideline for liberal or conservative fluid management in patients with established acute lung injury.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with explicit protocols for conservative or liberal fluid management applied for seven days in 1,000 patients with acute lung injury
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">1,000 patients with acute lung injury, intubated, and receiving positive-pressure ventilation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Participants were randomized to receive a conservative or liberal strategy of fluid management.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: Death from any cause at 60 days.
Secondary Outcomes: Number of ventilator-free days, organ-failureâ€“free days, and measures of lung physiology.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study focused on a 7-day intervention and may not have captured long-term sequelae of fluid management strategies.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by contracts with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health. No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.
