 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">The AMPLIFY trial demonstrated that a fixed-dose regimen of apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, was noninferior to conventional therapy for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and resulted in less major bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Updated guidelines now need to consider the evidence from this trial when prescribing therapy for acute venous thromboembolism.

- N=5395 patients with acute venous thromboembolism
- Apixaban group (n=2609)
- Conventional therapy group (n=2635)
- Setting: 358 centers in 28 countries
- Enrollment: August 2008 to August 2012
- Mean follow-up: 6 months
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria

 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Active bleeding or high risk of bleeding
- Cancer with planned long-term low-molecular-weight heparin therapy
- Provoked venous thromboembolism without a persistent risk factor for recurrence
- Life expectancy less than 6 months
- Other indications for chronic anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy
- Certain laboratory abnormalities
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Apixaban group: 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 months
- Conventional therapy group: Enoxaparin followed by warfarin for 6 months with adjustments to maintain INR between 2.0 and 3.0
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism occurred in 2.3% of the apixaban group versus 2.7% of the conventional therapy group (P<0.001 for noninferiority)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of the apixaban group versus 1.8% of the conventional therapy group (P<0.001 for superiority)
- The composite outcome of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 4.3% of the apixaban group versus 9.7% of the conventional therapy group (P<0.001)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Further information is needed pertaining to the efficacy and safety of apixaban in patients with cancer, low body weight, or a creatinine clearance of less than 50 ml per minute.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- The study was funded by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
