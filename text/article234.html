    "Extended Thromboprophylaxis with Aspirin versus Rivaroxaban after Total Hip or Knee Arthroplasty". The New England Journal of Medicine. Published online.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does extended prophylaxis with aspirin have noninferior effectiveness compared with rivaroxaban in the prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) after discharge in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Extended thromboprophylaxis with aspirin was noninferior to rivaroxaban for the prevention of symptomatic VTE after initial postoperative rivaroxaban prophylaxis in patients who underwent total hip or knee arthroplasty.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Venous thromboembolism is a common complication after total hip or knee arthroplasty. While direct oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, are commonly used for VTE prophylaxis post-surgery, aspirin has been proposed as a potentially effective and more affordable alternative. This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that aspirin had similar effectiveness to rivaroxaban in preventing symptomatic VTE when given for an extended duration post-surgery after an initial five-day course of rivaroxaban.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Evidence-based guidelines recommend postoperative anticoagulant prophylaxis for at least 14 days after total hip or knee arthroplasty. This study supports the use of aspirin as a secondary prevention strategy for VTE.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial<br/>
- N=3,424 patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty<br/>
- Intervention: Initial rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily) up to postoperative day 5, followed by aspirin (81 mg daily)<br/>
- Comparison: Continued rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily)<br/>
- Mean follow-up of 90 days<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Patients undergoing elective unilateral primary or revision hip or knee arthroplasty<br/>
- Excluded those with hip or lower limb fracture within the previous 3 months and with metastatic cancer<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Initial in-hospital prophylaxis with rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily), followed by random assignment to continued rivaroxaban or aspirin for an additional 9 days after knee arthroplasty or 30 days after hip arthroplasty<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary effectiveness outcome: Symptomatic VTE (proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism)<br/>
- Primary safety outcome: Major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The trial did not start both therapies immediately postoperative, so could not compute absolute event rates for thromboembolic or bleeding complications.<br/>
- Due to timing, some events occurred before the start of trial medication and were included in the primary analysis.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
- Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research<br/>
<br/>
