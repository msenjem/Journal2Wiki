 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Extended thromboprophylaxis with aspirin was noninferior to rivaroxaban for the prevention of symptomatic VTE after initial postoperative rivaroxaban prophylaxis in patients who underwent total hip or knee arthroplasty.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Venous thromboembolism is a common complication after total hip or knee arthroplasty. While direct oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, are commonly used for VTE prophylaxis post-surgery, aspirin has been proposed as a potentially effective and more affordable alternative. This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that aspirin had similar effectiveness to rivaroxaban in preventing symptomatic VTE when given for an extended duration post-surgery after an initial five-day course of rivaroxaban.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Evidence-based guidelines recommend postoperative anticoagulant prophylaxis for at least 14 days after total hip or knee arthroplasty. This study supports the use of aspirin as a secondary prevention strategy for VTE.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial
- N=3,424 patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty
- Intervention: Initial rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily) up to postoperative day 5, followed by aspirin (81 mg daily)
- Comparison: Continued rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily)
- Mean follow-up of 90 days
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients undergoing elective unilateral primary or revision hip or knee arthroplasty
- Excluded those with hip or lower limb fracture within the previous 3 months and with metastatic cancer
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Initial in-hospital prophylaxis with rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily), followed by random assignment to continued rivaroxaban or aspirin for an additional 9 days after knee arthroplasty or 30 days after hip arthroplasty
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary effectiveness outcome: Symptomatic VTE (proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism)
- Primary safety outcome: Major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial did not start both therapies immediately postoperative, so could not compute absolute event rates for thromboembolic or bleeding complications.
- Due to timing, some events occurred before the start of trial medication and were included in the primary analysis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The full text of the trial is published on The New England Journal of Medicine's website. Additional protocol, supplementary appendix, and disclosure forms are available as supplementary materials. </span></p>
