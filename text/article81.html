 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In high-risk patients without heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, ramipril significantly reduces the rates of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, cardiac arrest, and heart failure, as well as the risk of complications related to diabetes and the incidence of new diabetes cases.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study determined that in a broad population of high-risk patients without left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure, ramipril reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events. These findings argued for a benefit of ACE inhibitors in secondary prevention even among patients without overt heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last knowledge update, guidelines recommend the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with established cardiovascular disease for risk reduction, regardless of left ventricular function or presence of heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, two-by-two factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Men and women 55 years or older with evidence of vascular disease or diabetes, plus at least one cardiovascular risk factor, and no known low ejection fraction or heart failure.
- Baseline Characteristics: Age ≥55, 2480 women, 5128 ≥65 years old, 8162 with cardiovascular disease, 4355 with hypertension, 3577 with diabetes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Ramipril (10 mg once per day) vs. matching placebo.
- Mean follow-up of 5 years.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: A composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.
- Secondary Outcomes: Death from any cause, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure, complications related to diabetes, worsening angina, cardiac arrest, heart failure, and development of diabetes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Ramipril group had significantly fewer primary outcome events (14.0%) compared to the placebo group (17.8%; relative risk 0.78).
- Significant reductions in individual components of the primary endpoint and secondary outcomes were observed for ramipril versus placebo.
- Ramipril reduced the incidence of complications related to diabetes and new cases of diabetes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The significances of small blood pressure changes cannot be discounted as a contributing factor to the overall outcome.
- The overall generalizability to other populations was not explored within the scope of this study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Medical Research Council of Canada, Hoechst–Marion Roussel, AstraZeneca, King Pharmaceuticals, Natural Source Vitamin E Association and Negma, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario, and other organizations.
