 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with cancer and acute venous thromboembolism, dalteparin was more effective than oral anticoagulant therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent thromboembolism without increasing the risk of bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with cancer have an elevated risk of thrombotic events and face challenges with traditional anticoagulant therapy due to drug interactions, malnutrition, and other complications associated with their disease and treatment. The CLOT trial compared the efficacy of dalteparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, to that of oral anticoagulants (warfarin or acenocoumarol) in preventing recurrent thrombosis in these patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Guideline recommendations for anticoagulation in patients with cancer and venous thromboembolism were not provided in the article.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial
- N=676 patients with cancer and acute venous thromboembolism
- Dalteparin versus oral anticoagulant therapy
- Mean follow-up: 6 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adult patients with active cancer and newly diagnosed, symptomatic proximal deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both.
- Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, baseline platelet count less than 75,000/mmÂ³, and others related to anticoagulant therapy contraindications.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Dalteparin: 200 IU/kg subcutaneously once daily for the first month, followed by approximately 150 IU/kg for five months.
- Oral anticoagulant therapy: Initial therapy with dalteparin for five to seven days until INR within therapeutic range, followed by warfarin or acenocoumarol for six months (target INR, 2.5).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: First episode of objectively documented, symptomatic, recurrent venous thromboembolism during six-month study period.
  - 27 occurrences in the dalteparin group versus 53 in the oral-anticoagulant group (hazard ratio, 0.48; P=0.002).
- Secondary Outcomes: Major bleeding and any bleeding events.
  - Major bleeding: 6% in the dalteparin group, 4% in the oral-anticoagulant group (P=0.27).
  - Any bleeding: 14% in the dalteparin group, 19% in the oral-anticoagulant group (P=0.09).
- Mortality rate at six months: 39% in the dalteparin group, 41% in the oral-anticoagulant group (P=0.53).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The open-label design may have introduced reporting and diagnostic bias. Frequent contact and the use of objective tests for assessing suspected events, along with review by a blinded central committee, were methods utilized to mitigate this bias.
