 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Isosorbide mononitrate did not improve the daily activity level, submaximal exercise capacity, quality-of-life scores, or NT-proBNP levels, and actually decreased daily activity levels in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) often involves exercise intolerance. Nitrates may theoretically alleviate this issue by attenuating pulmonary congestion; however, effectiveness of nitrates in HFpEF is unproven. The NEAT-HFpEF trial showed that isosorbide mononitrate did not improve activity tolerance in HFpEF patients and might actually reduce daily activity.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The findings from NEAT-HFpEF suggest caution when considering isosorbide mononitrate for activity tolerance in HFpEF. No explicit guidelines were provided by the trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- **N** = 110 patients with HFpEF
- **Interventions**: Isosorbide mononitrate (30 mg to 120 mg once daily) vs placebo
- **Setting**: 20 US sites
- **Enrollment**: April 7, 2014, to October 30, 2014
- **Mean follow-up**: 6 weeks per treatment phase
- **Analysis**: Intention-to-treat
- **Primary outcome**: Average daily activity level assessed by accelerometry during 120-mg phase
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">#### Inclusion Criteria
- Heart failure diagnosis
- Age ≥50 years
- Ejection fraction ≥50%
- Objective evidence of heart failure (hospitalization for heart failure, elevated left ventricular end diastolic or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, elevated NT-proBNP or BNP levels, or echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction)
- Heart failure symptoms as the primary reason for limited activity
 </span></p><p><span class="main">#### Exclusion Criteria
- Systolic blood pressure <110 mm Hg or >180 mm Hg
- Adverse reaction or current use of long-term nitrate or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor therapy
 </span></p><p><span class="main">#### Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age 69 years, 57% female
- Majority were white and obese
- Majority had controlled blood pressure and multiple coexisting illnesses
- Most patients were on multiple cardiovascular medications
- Mean ejection fraction was 63%
  
### Interventions
- Isosorbide mononitrate - dose-escalation regimen 30 mg to 120 mg once daily for 6 weeks.
- Placebo for 6 weeks.
- Crossover design, so patients received both treatments sequentially with washout period.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">#### Primary Outcome
- No significant improvement in average daily activity levels during the 120-mg phase of isosorbide mononitrate vs placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Decrease in hours of activity per day with isosorbide mononitrate.
- No significant difference in 6-minute walk distance, quality-of-life scores, or NT-proBNP levels compared to placebo.
  
### Criticisms
- Rapid dose escalation of isosorbide mononitrate may have limited assessment of tolerability.
- Absence of longer-term outcomes assessment.
- No improvement in exercise tolerance and reduction of daily activity levels limits applicability.
