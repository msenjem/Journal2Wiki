    "Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure". The New England Journal of Medicine. 2005. 352(3):225-237.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with NYHA class II or III congestive heart failure (CHF) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35 percent or less, does implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy improve survival compared to amiodarone or placebo?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with NYHA class II or III CHF and an LVEF of 35 percent or less, implantation of a conservatively programmed, shock-only ICD reduced overall mortality by 23 percent, while amiodarone had no favorable effect on survival.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
At the time of writing, there were no specific guidelines provided from this trial. However, these results would typically inform guidelines recommending ICD insertion for patients with CHF and reduced LVEF.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial<br/>
- N=2,521 patients with recent CHF in NYHA class II or III<br/>
- Placebo (n=847), amiodarone (n=845), and ICD (n=829)<br/>
- Median follow-up: 45.5 months<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion criteria: Age ≥18 years, NYHA class II or III chronic CHF due to ischemic or nonischemic causes, and LVEF ≤35%<br/>
- Exclusion criteria: None detailed in the provided summary<br/>
- Baseline characteristics: Median LVEF 25%, 70% were in NYHA class II, 30% in NYHA class III. The cause of CHF was ischemic in 52% and nonischemic in 48%.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Patients were stabilized on conventional CHF therapy, including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, then randomized to amiodarone, placebo, or ICD.<br/>
- Amiodarone and placebo were given in a double-blind fashion. The dosage was based partly on weight.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary outcome: Death from any cause.<br/>
- Secondary outcomes: Not specified in the provided summary.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The ICD programming was conservative, using shock-only therapy, making its applicability to more advanced device programming and capabilities in clinical practice limited.<br/>
- The subgroup analysis showing the lack of benefit in NYHA class III CHF patients for ICD therapy was unexpected and should be interpreted with caution until replicated in other studies.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
- Supported by grants from the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, and by Medtronic, Wyeth–Ayerst Laboratories, and Knoll Pharmaceuticals.<br/>
- Further disclosures include a variety of financial relationships with sponsoring companies by several authors.<br/>
