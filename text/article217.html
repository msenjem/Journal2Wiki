    "Sofosbuvir–Ribavirin for Hepatitis C Genotype 2 or 3 in Patients without Treatment Options".The New England Journal of Medicine. 2014. <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does treatment with sofosbuvir-ribavirin for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 2 or 3 result in high rates of sustained virologic response in patients in need of a treatment option other than interferon?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Treatment with sofosbuvir-ribavirin for 12 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 2 infection and for 24 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 3 infection led to high rates of sustained virologic response, providing an alternative to interferon-based regimens.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection often have limited treatment options, especially those who have contraindications to interferon or have previously failed interferon-based therapy. The combination of sofosbuvir, a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor, and ribavirin has shown promise in clinical trials, particularly for these genotypes. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of sofosbuvir-ribavirin in these patient populations, with an original 12-week treatment plan revised during the course due to emerging evidence to 24-weeks for genotype 3 infection. A sustained virologic response was achieved in 93% of genotype 2 patients treated for 12 weeks and 85% of genotype 3 patients treated for 24 weeks, providing an effective interferon-free therapy option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of August 2017, no updated guidelines reflecting the results of this trial have been published regarding the use of sofosbuvir-ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotypes 2 or 3.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, descriptive study initially designed as a phase 3 trial, later amended to a descriptive study without hypothesis testing due to treatment duration changes based on emerging evidence.<br/>
N=419 patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions:</strong></h2><br/>
- Sofosbuvir (400 mg daily) plus weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks in genotype 2 infection (n=73)<br/>
- Sofosbuvir (400 mg daily) plus weight-based ribavirin for 24 weeks in genotype 3 infection (n=250)<br/>
Primary endpoint: Sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-therapy<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Age ≥18 years<br/>
- Chronic HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection with serum HCV RNA levels ≥10,000 IU/mL<br/>
- Eligible regardless of prior interferon-based therapy<br/>
- Approximately 20% could have cirrhosis.<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Major exclusion criteria detailed in the Supplementary Appendix.<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
- Gender: 40% female<br/>
- Cirrhosis: 21%<br/>
- Previously treated for HCV infection: 58%<br/>
- Characteristics balanced between genotype 2 and 3 patients.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Sofosbuvir (400 mg daily) orally plus ribavirin orally twice daily for either 12 or 24 weeks depending on HCV genotype.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcome: Sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-therapy<br/>
- Genotype 2 infection: 93% achieved sustained virologic response after 12-week treatment<br/>
- Genotype 3 infection: 85% achieved sustained virologic response after 24-week treatment<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Original randomized controlled trial design changed due to evolving evidence, leading to a lack of hypothesis testing or formal statistical comparisons.<br/>
- Lack of liver biopsy data limits the understanding of liver disease extent and subgroups that might benefit from longer or add-on therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
Supported by Gilead Sciences.<br/>
