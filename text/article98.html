 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does intensive lipid-lowering therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day provide additional clinical benefit for patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD) compared to 10 mg of atorvastatin per day when LDL cholesterol is already below 130 mg/dL?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Intensive lipid-lowering therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day in patients with stable CHD resulted in significant reductions in major cardiovascular events compared to treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin per day, despite a greater incidence of elevated aminotransferase levels.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prior studies have established the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol to prevent cardiovascular events. The TNT (Treating to New Targets) Study specifically evaluated whether lowering LDL cholesterol levels below the previously recommended 100 mg/dL provided extra benefits for patients with stable CHD. The study found that intensive therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin, which further reduced LDL cholesterol levels, led to a 22% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events compared to the standard 10 mg dose of atorvastatin. There was no difference in overall mortality between the two groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last knowledge update, guidelines recommend targeting lower levels of LDL cholesterol for secondary prevention in patients with a high risk of cardiovascular events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
- N=10,001 patients with clinically evident CHD and LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dL.
- Intervention: 80 mg atorvastatin per day (n=4995) or 10 mg atorvastatin per day (n=5006).
- Setting: 14 countries.
- Enrollment: 1998-1999.
- Mean follow-up: 4.9 years.
- Primary outcome: Major cardiovascular event (CHD death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, fatal or nonfatal stroke).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Men and women aged 35-75 years with clinically evident CHD.
- Baseline LDL cholesterol between 130-250 mg/dL.
- Triglyceride levels â‰¤600 mg/dL.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Patients with triglyceride levels >600 mg/dL or other exclusionary conditions.
- Patients did not tolerate initial 10 mg atorvastatin in run-in phase.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Participants had a history of previous myocardial infarction, angina with evidence of CHD, or coronary revascularization.
- Demographics were well matched between groups at baseline.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Discontinuation of previous lipid-regulating drugs followed by an atorvastatin 10 mg run-in phase.
- Randomization to double-blind therapy with either 10 mg or 80 mg atorvastatin daily.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- 8.7% patients in the 80 mg group experienced a primary event compared to 10.9% in the 10 mg group, resulting in an absolute event rate reduction of 2.2% and relative risk reduction of 22% (hazard ratio = 0.78; P<0.001).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Significant reductions in risk for major coronary events, cerebrovascular events, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure noted in the 80 mg group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by Pfizer.
