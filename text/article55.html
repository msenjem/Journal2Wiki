<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and hypertension or chronic kidney disease, does renal-artery stenting in addition to medical therapy improve clinical outcomes compared to medical therapy alone?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In a population with atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and either hypertension or chronic kidney disease, the addition of renal-artery stenting to comprehensive medical therapy did not improve clinical outcomes including cardiovascular and renal events.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Not addressed directly by guidelines at the time of the study publication.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial<br/>
N=947 patients with atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis<br/>
Medical therapy alone (n=480)<br/>
Medical therapy plus renal-artery stenting (n=467)<br/>
Median follow-up: 43 months<br/>
Analysis: Intention-to-treat<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
Patients with severe renal-artery stenosis who had systolic hypertension while taking two or more antihypertensive drugs or chronic kidney disease<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
Renal-artery stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia<br/>
Chronic kidney disease from a cause other than ischemic nephropathy or a serum creatinine level &gt;4.0 mg/dL<br/>
Kidney length &lt;7 cm<br/>
Lesions that could not be treated with a single stent<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
Medications at baseline and follow-up: antihypertensive drugs, antiplatelet therapy, statins, and medications for diabetes control<br/>
Mean number of antihypertensive medications: 2.1±1.6<br/>
Target blood pressure: &lt;140/90 mm Hg or &lt;130/80 mm Hg in diabetes or chronic kidney disease<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Participants were randomized to either medical therapy alone or stenting plus medical therapy. <br/>
Medical therapy included angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker candesartan, with or without hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine–atorvastatin, and other guideline-directed medications for blood pressure and lipid management.<br/>
The stent group underwent placement of a Palmaz Genesis stent and were given antiplatelet therapy before the procedure.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
Composite end point of death from cardiovascular or renal causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, progressive renal insufficiency, or need for permanent renal-replacement therapy.<br/>
No difference between groups (35.1% for stent group vs. 35.8% for medical therapy alone; hazard ratio 0.94; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.17; P=0.58)<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
No significant difference between groups in rates of individual primary end point components or all-cause mortality.<br/>
Modest but significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (−2.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, −4.4 to −0.2; P=0.03) favoring stent group.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
Patients enrolled could have renal-artery stenosis of 60% or more, and the debate about the severity of stenosis necessary for intervention is ongoing.<br/>
Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia were not included.<br/>
Some patients deemed eligible were not enrolled due to physician's preference, possibly affecting generalizability.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
Supported by grants from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Medications were donated by AstraZeneca and Pfizer; supplemental financial support was provided by Cordis and Pfizer.<br/>
