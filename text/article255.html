    "Prophylactic Platelet Transfusions in Hematologic Cancers".The New England Journal of Medicine. 2013.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does a policy of no prophylactic platelet transfusions in thrombocytopenic patients with hematologic cancers reduce WHO grade 2 or higher bleeding events as effectively as a standard prophylactic transfusion policy?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
A strategy of omitting prophylactic platelet transfusions was inferior to the standard practice of prophylactic transfusions in preventing bleeding events of WHO grade 2, 3, or 4 in patients with hematologic cancers and thrombocytopenia.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
The open-label, noninferiority randomized trial involved 600 patients who were assigned either to a no-prophylaxis policy or to receive standard prophylactic platelet transfusions when platelet counts were less than 10×10^9 per liter. The primary outcome was the occurrence of WHO grade 2 or higher bleeding events up to 30 days after randomization.<br/>
<br/>
The trial found that 50% of patients in the no-prophylaxis group experienced grade 2, 3, or 4 bleeding events, compared to 43% in the prophylaxis group, demonstrating the superiority of prophylactic platelet transfusions in reducing bleeding events. Platelet use was markedly reduced in the no-prophylaxis group, although patients also experienced more days with bleeding. Subgroup analysis showed similar rates of bleeding among patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation, irrespective of prophylaxis policy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines recommend prophylactic platelet transfusions for patients with hematologic cancers, especially for those undergoing chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomized, noninferiority trial conducted at 14 centers in the UK and Australia.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Patients ≥16 years of age with hematologic cancers undergoing chemotherapy or stem-cell transplantation, with existing or expected thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50×10^9 per liter).<br/>
- Exclusion Criteria: Previous WHO grade 3 or 4 bleeding events, WHO grade 2 bleeding during current admission, inherited hemostatic or thrombotic disorders, need for therapeutic anticoagulants, acute promyelocytic leukemia, known HLA antibodies, prior study participation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- No Prophylaxis Group: Did not receive prophylactic platelet transfusions unless platelet counts were less than 10×10^9 per liter.<br/>
- Prophylaxis Group: Received standard prophylactic platelet transfusions when platelet count was less than 10×10^9 per liter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcome: Percentage of patients with bleeding events of WHO grade 2, 3, or 4 up to 30 days post-randomization.<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes: Days with WHO grade 2, 3, or 4 bleeding; time to first grade 2, 3, or 4 bleeding episode; number of platelet and red-cell transfusions; days with platelet count less than 20×10^9 per liter; time until recovery from thrombocytopenia.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The primary bleeding assessment relies on patient and staff reporting, which could introduce variance between study centers.<br/>
- The trial was not powered to specifically determine whether withholding prophylactic transfusions in patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation is safe and effective.<br/>
