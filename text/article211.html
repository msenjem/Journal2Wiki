 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In adults with Clostridium difficile infection, how does fidaxomicin compare to vancomycin in terms of efficacy and safety?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Fidaxomicin treatment for C. difficile infection was noninferior to vancomycin for clinical cure rates and was associated with significantly lower rates of recurrence, especially in patients infected with non-North American Pulsed Field type 1 strains of C. difficile.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The emergence of hypervirulent strains of C. difficile (NAP1/BI/027) has increased the morbidity and mortality associated with C. difficile infection. Fidaxomicin is a macrocyclic antibiotic that has shown promise in targeting C. difficile with minimal systemic absorption and has a spectrum of activity that spares much of the natural gut flora. In this phase 3 clinical trial, fidaxomicin was found to be noninferior to vancomycin in terms of clinical cure rates and had significantly lower recurrence rates.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, no specific guidelines are provided pertaining to the trial results. Typically, clinical practice guidelines are periodically updated to reflect new evidence, and fidaxomicin may be included based on these results.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial
- N=629 patients with acute C. difficile infection
- Fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily) or vancomycin (125 mg four times daily)
- Primary endpoint: Clinical cure
- Secondary endpoints: Recurrence of C. difficile infection and global cure
- Setting: 52 sites in the United States and 15 sites in Canada
- Enrollment: May 9, 2006, and August 21, 2008
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adults (≥16 years) with acute symptoms of C. difficile infection and a positive stool toxin test
Inclusion Criteria
- ≥3 unformed bowel movements in the 24-hour period before randomization
- Positive C. difficile toxin A, B, or both in a stool specimen within 48 hours before randomization
Exclusion Criteria
- Life-threatening or fulminant C. difficile infection, toxic megacolon, previous exposure to fidaxomicin, history of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, or more than one occurrence of C. difficile infection within 3 months before the study
Baseline Characteristics
- Similar across treatment groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Double-blind assignment of either fidaxomicin 200 mg BID with placebo doses or vancomycin 125 mg QID for 10 days
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Clinical cure rate post-treatment (fidaxomicin: 88.2% in modified intention-to-treat analysis and 92.1% in per-protocol analysis; vancomycin: 85.8% and 89.8%, respectively)
Secondary Outcomes
- Recurrence rate (fidaxomicin: 15.4% in modified intention-to-treat analysis; vancomycin: 25.3%)
- Global cure rate (fidaxomicin: 74.6% in modified intention-to-treat analysis; vancomycin: 64.1%)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Although the non-inferiority design showed fidaxomicin was at least as effective as vancomycin, questions remain regarding long-term outcomes beyond the scope of the study.
- Cost-effectiveness of fidaxomicin in comparison to vancomycin was not addressed.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by Optimer Pharmaceuticals; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00314951.
