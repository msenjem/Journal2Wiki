                                        </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does 3 months of directly observed once-weekly therapy with rifapentine plus isoniazid compare with 9 months of self-administered daily isoniazid in preventing tuberculosis?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Three months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid is as effective as a standard 9-month regimen of daily isoniazid alone in preventing tuberculosis, with a higher rate of treatment completion and a similar side-effect profile.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Treatment of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is key in tuberculosis control. The conventional 9-month isoniazid regimen is effective but has low completion rates and potential toxicity. This study compared a shorter 3-month regimen with once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid, administered under direct observation, to the standard 9-month self-administered isoniazid. The shorter regimen proved to be as effective, with higher completion rates and fewer incidents of hepatotoxicity.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last update, guidelines for treating latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection did not include this specific rifapentine plus isoniazid regimen.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Open-label, randomized noninferiority trial conducted in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Spain.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">7,731 subjects at high risk for tuberculosis, including 71% who were close contacts of patients with tuberculosis and 25% with recent conversion to positive tuberculin skin tests.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Subjects were randomized to the combination-therapy group (3 months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid under direct observation) or the isoniazid-only group (9 months of daily self-administered isoniazid).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Tuberculosis developed in 7 of 3986 subjects in the combination-therapy group (rate 0.19%) and in 15 of 3745 subjects in the isoniazid-only group (rate 0.43%).
- Secondary Outcomes: Treatment completion rates were 82.1% in the combination-therapy group and 69.0% in the isoniazid-only group. 
- Permanent drug discontinuation due to adverse events was seen in 4.9% in the combination-therapy group and in 3.7% in the isoniazid-only group. 
- Investigator-assessed drug-related hepatotoxicity occurred in 0.4% of combination-therapy group versus 2.7% in isoniazid-only group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Noninferiority margin may be considered high.
- Limited data on HIV-infected subjects.
- Need for long-term safety monitoring.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- PREVENT TB ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00023452.
