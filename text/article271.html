    "Rifapentine and Isoniazid for 3 Months versus Isoniazid for 9 Months".<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does 3 months of directly observed once-weekly therapy with rifapentine plus isoniazid compare with 9 months of self-administered daily isoniazid in preventing tuberculosis?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Three months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid is as effective as a standard 9-month regimen of daily isoniazid alone in preventing tuberculosis, with a higher rate of treatment completion and a similar side-effect profile.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Treatment of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is key in tuberculosis control. The conventional 9-month isoniazid regimen is effective but has low completion rates and potential toxicity. This study compared a shorter 3-month regimen with once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid, administered under direct observation, to the standard 9-month self-administered isoniazid. The shorter regimen proved to be as effective, with higher completion rates and fewer incidents of hepatotoxicity.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of the last update, guidelines for treating latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection did not include this specific rifapentine plus isoniazid regimen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Open-label, randomized noninferiority trial conducted in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Spain.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
7,731 subjects at high risk for tuberculosis, including 71% who were close contacts of patients with tuberculosis and 25% with recent conversion to positive tuberculin skin tests.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Subjects were randomized to the combination-therapy group (3 months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid under direct observation) or the isoniazid-only group (9 months of daily self-administered isoniazid).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcome: Tuberculosis developed in 7 of 3986 subjects in the combination-therapy group (rate 0.19%) and in 15 of 3745 subjects in the isoniazid-only group (rate 0.43%).<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes: Treatment completion rates were 82.1% in the combination-therapy group and 69.0% in the isoniazid-only group. <br/>
- Permanent drug discontinuation due to adverse events was seen in 4.9% in the combination-therapy group and in 3.7% in the isoniazid-only group. <br/>
- Investigator-assessed drug-related hepatotoxicity occurred in 0.4% of combination-therapy group versus 2.7% in isoniazid-only group.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Noninferiority margin may be considered high.<br/>
- Limited data on HIV-infected subjects.<br/>
- Need for long-term safety monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
