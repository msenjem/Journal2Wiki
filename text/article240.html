 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The prevalence of occult cancer in patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism is low, and routine CT screening of the abdomen and pelvis does not provide a clinically significant benefit in detecting missed cancers or reducing cancer-related mortality.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism have an elevated risk of an underlying occult cancer. Screening for occult cancer aims to detect and treat cancer early, potentially reducing cancer-related mortality. However, there is currently high variability in screening practices. The SOME trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of adding CT of the abdomen and pelvis to limited occult-cancer screening versus limited screening alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Guidelines for cancer screening in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism vary, with some recommending limited occult-cancer screening, while others suggest more extensive modalities.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial
N=854 patients with first unprovoked symptomatic venous thromboembolism
Limited occult-cancer screening group (n=431)
Limited occult-cancer screening plus CT group (n=423)
Enrollment: October 2008 to April 2014
Follow-up: 1 year
Intention-to-treat analysis
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Patients with a new diagnosis of first unprovoked symptomatic venous thromboembolism.
Exclusion Criteria: Age <18 years, inability to provide informed consent, allergy to contrast media, creatinine clearance <60 ml/min, claustrophobia or agoraphobia, weight >130 kg, ulcerative colitis, or glaucoma.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were assigned to undergo limited screening (history, physical examination, basic blood testing, chest radiography, and age- and sex-specific cancer screening) or limited screening plus CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: Confirmed cancer missed by the screening strategy and detected by the end of the 1-year follow-up period.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Secondary Outcomes: Total number of occult cancers diagnosed, number of early cancers diagnosed, 1-year cancer-related mortality, 1-year overall mortality, time to cancer diagnosis, incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Open-label design may introduce bias. The screening did not include CT of the chest as many patients had undergone CT pulmonary angiography for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
