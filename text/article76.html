 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with left main coronary artery disease of low or intermediate anatomical complexity, PCI with everolimus-eluting stents was noninferior to CABG with respect to the composite end point of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction at 3 years.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">CABG has been the standard treatment for patients with obstructive left main coronary artery disease. Randomized trials had previously suggested that drug-eluting stents could be a potential alternative to CABG for selected patients with left main disease. The EXCEL trial compared everolimus-eluting stents with CABG in this patient population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">European and U.S. guidelines recommend most patients with left main coronary artery disease undergo CABG. PCI with drug-eluting stents might be an acceptable alternative for selected patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, open-label, randomized trial
- N=1,905 patients with left main coronary artery disease
- PCI with everolimus-eluting stents (n=948)
- CABG (n=957)
- Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score ≤32
- Setting: 126 sites in 17 countries
- Enrollment: 2010-2014
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Composite of death from any cause, stroke, or myocardial infarction at 3 years
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Stenosis of left main coronary artery ≥70% visually estimated, or 50% to <70% with hemodynamic significance determined by noninvasive or invasive testing
- Anatomical complexity of coronary artery disease, defined by SYNTAX score ≤32
- CABG or PCI candidacy confirmed by a heart team
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- SYNTAX score >32
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics:
- Well balanced between groups
- SYNTAX score: Low (≤22) in 60.5%, intermediate (23-32) in 39.5%
- Distal left main bifurcation/trifurcation disease: 80.5%
- Two-vessel or three-vessel disease: 51.3%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- PCI goal: Complete revascularization of all ischemic territories
- CABG goal: Complete anatomical revascularization of all vessels ≥1.5 mm with angiographic diameter stenosis ≥50%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes:
- Composite of death, stroke, or MI at 3 years occurred in 15.4% (PCI) vs. 14.7% (CABG) (noninferiority margin, 4.2 percentage points; P=0.02 for noninferiority)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Composite of death, stroke, or MI at 30 days: 4.9% (PCI) vs. 7.9% (CABG) (P<0.001 for noninferiority, P=0.008 for superiority)
- Composite of death, stroke, MI, or ischemia-driven revascularization at 3 years: 23.1% (PCI) vs. 19.1% (CABG) (P=0.01 for noninferiority)

 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The EXCEL trial was published in full in The New England Journal of Medicine, with more comprehensive data on the outcomes and trial methodology available in the published article and supplementary materials. </span></p>
