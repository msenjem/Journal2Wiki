<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does the addition of early continuous neuromuscular blockade with concomitant deep sedation reduce in-hospital mortality at 90 days compared with usual care with lighter sedation targets in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, the addition of early continuous neuromuscular blockade with concomitant deep sedation did not result in a significant difference in mortality at 90 days compared to usual care with lighter sedation targets.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, unblinded clinical trial<br/>
- N=1,006 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS<br/>
- Intervention group received 48-hour continuous infusion of cisatracurium with concomitant deep sedation<br/>
- Control group received usual care without routine neuromuscular blockade and lighter sedation targets<br/>
- Primary outcome: In-hospital mortality at 90 days<br/>
- Trial was stopped early for futility based on the second interim analysis<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Patients under mechanical ventilation for less than 48 hours for moderate-to-severe ARDS<br/>
- Exclusion Criteria: Various, including cardiac failure or fluid overload as the primary cause of respiratory failure; see full list in the Supplementary Appendix of the original study<br/>
- Baseline Characteristics: Similar in both groups<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Intervention group: 48-hour continuous infusion of cisatracurium with deep sedation<br/>
- Control group: Standard care including lighter sedation targets<br/>
- Same ventilation strategies, including high PEEP, used in both groups<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcome: In-hospital death from any cause at 90 days. 42.5% in the intervention group and 42.8% in the control group (between-group difference, −0.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −6.4 to 5.9; P=0.93)<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes: Similar between groups in terms of days free of organ dysfunction, days not in ICU, days free of mechanical ventilation, and days not hospitalized at day 28.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Early exclusion of eligible patients who had previously received neuromuscular blockade could have affected results. <br/>
- Treatment was not blinded, potentially influencing assessments of muscle strength and the level of physical activity.<br/>
- Possible underuse of prone positioning, which has been shown to reduce mortality in ARDS, might have influenced results.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
- Supported by grants from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.<br/>
