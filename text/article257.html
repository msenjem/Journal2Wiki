 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, was found to accelerate the recovery of hospitalized adults with Covid-19 compared to placebo, reducing the median recovery time from 15 days to 10 days. The study also suggested that remdesivir may prevent progression to severe respiratory disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19 in adults and children hospitalized with suspected or laboratory-confirmed Covid-19. This has been modified and granted full or conditional approval in other countries since that time.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=1,062 patients with recent confirmation of Covid-19 and lower respiratory tract infection
- Intervention: Remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) (n=541)
- Control: Placebo for up to 10 days (n=521)
- Setting: 60 trial sites and 13 subsites across 10 countries
- Enrollment: February 21 to April 19, 2020
- Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat
- Primary Outcome: Time to recovery by day 29
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adult patients hospitalized with Covid-19
- Categorized as having mild-to-moderate (15.0%) or severe disease (85.0%)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Remdesivir: 200 mg intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days
- Control group received a matching placebo
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: Time to recovery (median of 10 days for remdesivir vs. 15 days for placebo)
- Secondary: Clinical status at day 15, mortality at days 15 and 29, use of health care resources
- Mortality at day 15 was 6.7% for remdesivir and 11.9% for placebo; day 29 was 11.4% for remdesivir and 15.2% for placebo
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Treatment with the antiviral drug alone is likely insufficient for all patients
- Mortality reduction was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), other governmental and institutional contributors. Remdesivir provided by Gilead Sciences with no financial support.
