    "Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 â€” Final Report". The New England Journal of Medicine. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2007764.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does intravenous remdesivir expedite recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and lower respiratory tract infection compared to placebo?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, was found to accelerate the recovery of hospitalized adults with Covid-19 compared to placebo, reducing the median recovery time from 15 days to 10 days. The study also suggested that remdesivir may prevent progression to severe respiratory disease.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19 in adults and children hospitalized with suspected or laboratory-confirmed Covid-19. This has been modified and granted full or conditional approval in other countries since that time.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial<br/>
- N=1,062 patients with recent confirmation of Covid-19 and lower respiratory tract infection<br/>
- Intervention: Remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) (n=541)<br/>
- Control: Placebo for up to 10 days (n=521)<br/>
- Setting: 60 trial sites and 13 subsites across 10 countries<br/>
- Enrollment: February 21 to April 19, 2020<br/>
- Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat<br/>
- Primary Outcome: Time to recovery by day 29<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Adult patients hospitalized with Covid-19<br/>
- Categorized as having mild-to-moderate (15.0%) or severe disease (85.0%)<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Remdesivir: 200 mg intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days<br/>
- Control group received a matching placebo<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary: Time to recovery (median of 10 days for remdesivir vs. 15 days for placebo)<br/>
- Secondary: Clinical status at day 15, mortality at days 15 and 29, use of health care resources<br/>
- Mortality at day 15 was 6.7% for remdesivir and 11.9% for placebo; day 29 was 11.4% for remdesivir and 15.2% for placebo<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Treatment with the antiviral drug alone is likely insufficient for all patients<br/>
- Mortality reduction was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03)<br/>
