    "Vitamin D, Omega-3 Trial (VITAL)". The New England Journal of Medicine. 2018. DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa1811403.<br/>
<br/>
### Clinical Question<br/>
Does supplementation with Vitamin D (2000 IU/day) reduce the risk of cancer or cardiovascular disease among older adults?<br/>
<br/>
### Bottom Line<br/>
Supplementation with Vitamin D did not result in a lower incidence of invasive cancer or cardiovascular events compared to a placebo.<br/>
<br/>
### Major Points<br/>
VITAL was a large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that tested the effects of daily Vitamin D (2000 IU) and Omega-3 fatty acids (1 g) on the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in older adults. With a median 5.3 years follow-up, neither the incidence of invasive cancer nor major cardiovascular events was reduced by Vitamin D supplementation.<br/>
<br/>
### Guidelines<br/>
Current guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force report insufficient data to evaluate the effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation for cancer or cardiovascular disease prevention.<br/>
<br/>
### Design<br/>
- Nationwide, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two-by-two factorial design<br/>
- N=25,871 men (aged ≥50) and women (aged ≥55)<br/>
- Intervention: Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU/day<br/>
- Comparators: Placebo<br/>
- Primary endpoints: invasive cancer of any type, major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes)<br/>
- Secondary endpoints: site-specific cancers, death from cancer, and additional cardiovascular events<br/>
- Median follow-up: 5.3 years<br/>
<br/>
### Population<br/>
- Inclusion criteria: Men ≥50 years old and women ≥55 years old, no history of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) or cardiovascular disease at trial entry<br/>
- Exclusion criteria: History of various serious conditions, including hypercalcemia and renal failure<br/>
- Baseline characteristics: Mean age 67.1 years, 51% women, racially diverse (20% black participants)<br/>
<br/>
### Interventions<br/>
- Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU per day<br/>
<br/>
### Outcomes<br/>
- Primary outcomes: Invasive cancer (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88-1.06), major cardiovascular events (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.12)<br/>
- Secondary outcomes: No significant differences in site-specific cancers or cardiovascular events<br/>
- Death from cancer: Non-significant reduction (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67-1.02)<br/>
- Adverse events: Hypercalcemia, kidney stones, and gastrointestinal symptoms were not significantly different between the Vitamin D and placebo groups<br/>
<br/>
### Criticisms<br/>
- The lack of significant results may be due to the study design, including the duration of follow-up and the selected Vitamin D dose.<br/>
- Subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution, as they were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.<br/>
<br/>
### Funding<br/>
- Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others<br/>
- Trial agents donated by Pharmavite (Vitamin D) and Pronova BioPharma/BASF (fish oil)<br/>
<br/>
