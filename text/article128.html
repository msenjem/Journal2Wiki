 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The initiation of sacubitril–valsartan therapy resulted in a greater reduction in the NT-proBNP concentration than enalapril therapy in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups with regard to key safety outcomes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In PIONEER-HF, 881 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were randomized to receive either sacubitril–valsartan or enalapril. Compared with enalapril, sacubitril–valsartan led to a greater reduction in NT-proBNP concentrations without significant differences in worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension, and angioedema.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not reflect the results of this trial for in-hospital initiation of sacubitril–valsartan therapy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial; N=881 patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients aged ≥18 years with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">#### Inclusion Criteria
- Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%
- NT-proBNP ≥1600 pg/mL or BNP ≥400 pg/mL
- Signs and symptoms of fluid overload
 </span></p><p><span class="main">#### Exclusion Criteria
- Systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg
- Recent intravenous use of vasodilators or inotropes
 </span></p><p><span class="main">#### Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age: 61±14 years
- Male: 72.1%
- Black ethnicity: 35.9%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">After hemodynamic stabilization, patients were randomly assigned to:
- Sacubitril–valsartan (target dose, 97 mg/103 mg twice daily)
- Enalapril (target dose, 10 mg twice daily)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">#### Primary Outcomes
- Time-averaged proportional change in NT-proBNP levels from baseline through weeks 4 and 8. Greater reduction seen with sacubitril–valsartan (percent change, −46.7% vs. −25.3%; P<0.001).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension, and angioedema did not differ significantly between groups.
- A reduction in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T concentration with sacubitril–valsartan.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial protocol required specific conditions for in-hospital initiation of therapy, which may have prolonged hospital stay.
- Loss to follow-up and missing data were present, although multiple imputation analysis accounted for these.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Novartis.
