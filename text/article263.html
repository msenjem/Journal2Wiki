    "Immediate Antiretroviral Therapy in Early HIV Infection". The New England Journal of Medicine. 2015.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question  </strong></h2><br/>
Does immediate antiretroviral therapy provide benefits over deferred antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive adults with a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line  </strong></h2><br/>
Immediate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive adults with a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter provided net benefits over starting therapy after the CD4+ count had declined to 350 cells per cubic millimeter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points  </strong></h2><br/>
The Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (START) trial was designed to determine the risks and benefits of immediate versus deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with high CD4+ counts. The trial concluded with strong evidence supporting the immediate initiation of therapy, showing benefits for both serious AIDS-related and serious non–AIDS-related events, with no increased adverse effects.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines  </strong></h2><br/>
The results of this trial provide evidence that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended for all patients diagnosed with HIV, regardless of CD4+ count, aligning individual health benefits with public health goals to reduce HIV transmission.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design  </strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial <br/>
- N=4,685 HIV-positive adults with a CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter <br/>
- Immediate antiretroviral therapy (n=2,326) <br/>
- Deferred antiretroviral therapy (n=2,359) <br/>
- Median follow-up: 3.0 years <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population  </strong></h2><br/>
- Adults aged ≥18 years <br/>
- HIV-positive <br/>
- CD4+ count of more than 500 cells per cubic millimeter <br/>
- No history of AIDS <br/>
- Generally good health <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions  </strong></h2><br/>
- Immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy <br/>
- Deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy until CD4+ count decreased to 350 cells per cubic millimeter, development of AIDS, or another condition dictating the use of therapy <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes  </strong></h2><br/>
- Primary outcome: Composite of any serious AIDS-related event, serious non–AIDS-related event, or death from any cause <br/>
- Secondary outcomes: Serious AIDS-related events, serious non–AIDS-related events, death from any cause, grade 4 events, and unscheduled hospitalizations <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms  </strong></h2><br/>
- Despite the long duration of the study, 3 years is a short period for patients expected to require lifelong therapy, and the impact of long-term therapy is still uncertain.<br/>
- The absolute differences in outcomes between immediate and deferred therapy groups were small, impacting decision-making for some low-risk patients.<br/>
- The study did not fully evaluate the effects of immediate therapy on individual serious non-AIDS conditions like cardiovascular disease.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding  </strong></h2><br/>
- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and several other institutes and international bodies.<br/>
- Antiretroviral drugs were donated by several pharmaceutical companies.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Further Reading  </strong></h2><br/>
- The full START study report, supplementary materials, and editorial comments are available at the New England Journal of Medicine website.
