    "Management Strategies for Atrial Fibrillation". The New England Journal of Medicine. Date published/updated. Volume(Issue):Page range.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question:</strong></h2><br/>
Does a rhythm-control strategy offer a survival advantage over a rate-control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk for stroke, a rhythm-control strategy does not offer a survival advantage over a rate-control strategy, and may be associated with a higher risk of adverse drug effects. Continuous anticoagulation is important in this population, even when sinus rhythm is restored and maintained.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points:</strong></h2><br/>
The study compared two approaches for managing atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients at high risk of stroke: rhythm-control (aimed at maintaining sinus rhythm through antiarrhythmic drugs) versus rate-control (allowing AF to persist while controlling heart rate with rate-controlling medication). No significant mortality benefit was observed with rhythm-control despite higher hospitalizations and adverse drug events, suggesting rate-control strategy may offer equivalent outcomes with potentially lower risk.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines:</strong></h2><br/>
Existing guidelines recommend the use of anticoagulation in the management of AF in high-risk patients. The choice between rhythm-control and rate-control strategies should be made based on individual patient factors without an inherent preference for one strategy over another based on survival.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design:</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing rhythm-control to rate-control strategies in patients with AF.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population:</strong></h2><br/>
- Patients enrolled: 4,060<br/>
- Mean age: 69.7 years<br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Patients with AF and high risk of stroke or death, age â‰¥65 or other risk factors for stroke.<br/>
- Exclusion Criteria: Patients for whom anticoagulant therapy was contraindicated or for whom either strategy was inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions:</strong></h2><br/>
- Rhythm-control group: Use of antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) and possible cardioversion.<br/>
- Rate-control group: Use of rate-controlling drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers) with the option of AV nodal ablation and pacing if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes:</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcome: Overall mortality<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes: Composite of death, disabling stroke, disabling anoxic encephalopathy, major bleeding, or cardiac arrest.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms:</strong></h2><br/>
- Cross-over rates were higher among the rhythm-control group, reflecting difficulty in maintaining sinus rhythm.<br/>
- Anticoagulation treatment adherence varied throughout the trial.<br/>
- Study results may not apply to younger patients without risk factors for stroke (e.g., lone AF).<br/>
