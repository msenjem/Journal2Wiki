    "Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds versus Metallic Stents in Routine PCI"<br/>
The New England Journal of Medicine. Date: March 29, 2017.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Is a bioresorbable vascular scaffold noninferior to a metallic stent regarding target-vessel failure in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In routine PCI, there was no significant difference in the rate of target-vessel failure between patients who received a bioresorbable scaffold and those who received a metallic stent. However, the bioresorbable scaffold was associated with a higher incidence of device thrombosis than the metallic stent through 2 years of follow-up.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
No guideline recommendations are provided in the article due to the presentation of preliminary results.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Investigator-initiated, randomized, single-blind, multicenter, noninferiority trial.<br/>
- N=1845 patients undergoing PCI.<br/>
- Interventions: bioresorbable vascular scaffold (n=924) versus metallic stent (n=921).<br/>
- Median follow-up period: 707 days.<br/>
- Primary endpoint: target-vessel failure (composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI.<br/>
- Exclusion Criteria: Target lesions &gt;70 mm in length, reference vessel diameter &lt;2.5 mm or &gt;4 mm, planned bifurcation lesions requiring two stents, in-stent restenosis.<br/>
- Baseline Characteristics: Well-balanced demographics with a significant portion of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (54%).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either an everolimus-eluting BVS or an everolimus-eluting metallic stent<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcome: Target-vessel failure occurred in 11.7% of the scaffold group and 10.7% of the stent group (HR 1.12; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.48; P=0.43).<br/>
- Secondary Outcome: Cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization rates did not differ significantly between groups.<br/>
- Additional Analyses: Definite or probable device thrombosis was recorded in 3.5% of the scaffold group versus 0.9% of the stent group (HR 3.87; 95% CI, 1.78 to 8.42; P&lt;0.001).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
The occurrence of higher device thrombosis despite comparable rates of target-vessel failure raises questions regarding the advantages of BVS over DES. Additionally, the study did not perform routine intravascular imaging, limiting the understanding of device thrombosis mechanisms.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The trial was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Abbott Vascular.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Further Reading</strong></h2><br/>
More long-term follow-up data from this trial and ongoing research involving the next-generation BVS with modified features will be crucial to determine the potential benefits and identify strategies to mitigate device thrombosis risk.
