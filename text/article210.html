 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Duodenal infusion of donor feces (fecal microbiota transplantation) is significantly more effective for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection than vancomycin therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Recurrent C. difficile infection poses a significant treatment challenge, with high failure rates for standard antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a potential solution with promising results in case series and uncontrolled studies. This trial provides strong evidence supporting the use of FMT in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection.

- N=43 patients with recurrent C. difficile infection
- Interventions:
  - Duodenal infusion of donor feces after a short course of vancomycin and bowel lavage (n=17)
  - Standard vancomycin regimen (500 mg orally four times per day for 14 days) (n=13)
  - Standard vancomycin regimen with bowel lavage (n=13)
- Duration of follow-up: 10 weeks
- Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Cure without relapse of C. difficile infection at 10 weeks

 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Age at least 18 years with a life expectancy of at least 3 months
- Relapse of C. difficile infection after at least one course of adequate antibiotic therapy
- Diarrhea and a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin

- Vancomycin alone cured 4 of 13 patients (31%).
- Vancomycin with bowel lavage cured 3 of 13 patients (23%).
- The difference between the donor feces infusion group and each vancomycin group was statistically significant (P<0.001).
