 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">PSA-based screening reduced the rate of death from prostate cancer by 20% but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) was designed to determine whether PSA-based screening could lead to a significant reduction in prostate-cancer mortality. Conducted over a median follow-up of 9 years among men aged 50-74, the study found a 20% relative reduction in the rate of death from prostate cancer among men aged 55-69 at study entry. However, a substantial number of men needed to be screened (1410) and additional cases treated (48) to prevent one prostate cancer death.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The ERSPC does not directly create guidelines but offers critical data for informing prostate cancer screening decisions.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized control trial
- N=182,000 men (ages 50-74) identified through registries in seven European countries
- Intervention: Offered PSA screening every 4 years; control: No screening
- Core age group: 162,243 men (ages 55-69 years)
- Median follow-up: 9 years
- Primary outcome: Rate of death from prostate cancer, with follow-up ending December 31, 2006
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Men ages 50 to 74 years
- Exclusion Criteria: Men with diagnosed prostate cancer
- Baseline Characteristics: Mean age was 60.8 years
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Screening group offered PSA tests average once every 4 years; various interventions like biopsies based on elevated PSA values
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Rate of death from prostate cancer
  - 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; adjusted P=0.04) rate ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group
  - To prevent one death from prostate cancer, 1,410 men needed to be screened and 48 additional prostate cancer cases needed to be treated
- Secondary Outcomes: Not discussed in the provided abstract
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Overdiagnosis and subsequent treatment of indolent cancers that might not impact longevity or quality of life
- The significant number of men requiring screening and treatment to prevent one prostate cancer death, indicating overtreatment potential
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by grants from Europe Against Cancer, European Union framework programs, agencies or health authorities of the participating countries, alongside unconditional grants from Beckman Coulter
