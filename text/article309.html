**Clinical Question**<br/>
Does PSA-based screening reduce the mortality from prostate cancer in men aged 50-74 years?<br/>
<br/>
**Bottom Line**<br/>
PSA-based screening reduced the rate of death from prostate cancer by 20% but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
**Major Points**<br/><br/>
<br/>
**Guidelines**<br/><br/>
<br/>
**Design**<br/>
- Multicenter, randomized control trial<br/>
- N=182,000 men (ages 50-74) identified through registries in seven European countries<br/>
- Intervention: Offered PSA screening every 4 years; control: No screening<br/>
- Core age group: 162,243 men (ages 55-69 years)<br/>
- Median follow-up: 9 years<br/>
- Primary outcome: Rate of death from prostate cancer, with follow-up ending December 31, 2006<br/>
<br/>
**Population**<br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Men ages 50 to 74 years<br/>
- Exclusion Criteria: Men with diagnosed prostate cancer<br/>
- Baseline Characteristics: Mean age was 60.8 years<br/>
<br/>
**Interventions**<br/>
- Screening group offered PSA tests average once every 4 years; various interventions like biopsies based on elevated PSA values<br/>
<br/>
**Outcomes**<br/>
- Primary Outcome: Rate of death from prostate cancer<br/>
  - 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; adjusted P=0.04) rate ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group<br/>
  - To prevent one death from prostate cancer, 1,410 men needed to be screened and 48 additional prostate cancer cases needed to be treated<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes: Not discussed in the provided abstract<br/>
<br/>
**Criticisms**<br/>
- Overdiagnosis and subsequent treatment of indolent cancers that might not impact longevity or quality of life<br/>
- The significant number of men requiring screening and treatment to prevent one prostate cancer death, indicating overtreatment potential<br/>
<br/>
**Funding**<br/>
- Funded by grants from Europe Against Cancer, European Union framework programs, agencies or health authorities of the participating countries, alongside unconditional grants from Beckman Coulter<br/>
