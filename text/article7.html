 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with unstable coronary artery disease (angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction), is low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) more effective than standard unfractionated heparin in combination with aspirin in reducing ischemic events?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction, enoxaparin plus aspirin was more effective than unfractionated heparin plus aspirin in reducing the incidence of ischemic events at 14 and 30 days, without a significant increase in major bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Unfractionated heparin therapy has a notable failure rate in unstable coronary artery disease due to its unpredictable anticoagulant response and potential for rebound events after discontinuation. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) offers several advantages, such as predictable anticoagulant effect, ease of administration, and resistance to activated platelet inhibition, making it a promising alternative.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last knowledge update, specific guidelines reflecting the direct comparison of LMWH and unfractionated heparin in unstable coronary artery disease were not detailed, and further studies may contribute to guideline recommendations.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial.
- N=3,171 patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction.
- Setting: 176 hospitals in 10 countries.
- Enrolled from October 1994 to May 1996.
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat.
- Primary outcome: Composite of death, myocardial infarction (reinfarction), or recurrent angina at 14 days.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Recent angina at rest or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction within 24 hours before randomization.
- Evidence of underlying ischemic heart disease.
- Age at least 18 years.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Left bundle-branch block, persistent ST-segment elevation, angina with established precipitating cause, contraindications to anticoagulation, creatinine clearance rate <30 ml per minute.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Similar across treatment groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Enoxaparin (LMWH) 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours or continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin.
- Adjusted according to activated partial-thromboplastin time.
- Therapy duration: Minimum of 48 hours to a maximum of 8 days.
- All patients received 100–325 mg of oral aspirin daily.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Composite of death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent angina at 14 days: 16.6% in enoxaparin group vs. 19.8% in unfractionated heparin group (P=0.019).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Composite of death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent angina at 30 days: 19.8% enoxaparin vs. 23.3% unfractionated heparin (P=0.016).
- Need for revascularization at 30 days: 27.0% enoxaparin vs. 32.2% unfractionated heparin (P=0.001).
- Incidence of major bleeding: 6.5% enoxaparin vs. 7.0% unfractionated heparin.
- Incidence of bleeding overall: 18.4% enoxaparin vs. 14.2% unfractionated heparin (P=0.001), primarily due to ecchymoses at injection sites.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The occurrence of minor bleeding was significantly higher in the enoxaparin group, mainly due to injection-site ecchymosis.
- Superiority of enoxaparin might be influenced by the challenges in achieving the therapeutic range with unfractionated heparin.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was supported by the Rhône-Poulenc Rorer Corporation.
