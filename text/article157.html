 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The PRAETORIAN trial was a noninferiority study comparing subcutaneous and transvenous ICDs. Subcutaneous ICDs, designed to avoid transvenous lead-related complications, encompass extrathoracic placement, precluding the need for vascular access or intracardiac leads. This trial aimed to determine if the subcutaneous ICD was noninferior to the transvenous ICD regarding device-related complications and inappropriate shocks. The study found that, in patients with indications for ICD therapy but without pacing needs, the subcutaneous ICD demonstrated noninferiority to the transvenous ICD for the primary composite endpoint. The study also recorded similar rates of death but a higher incidence of appropriate shocks with the subcutaneous ICD.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend ICD therapy for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in specific patient populations at high risk and for secondary prevention in patients who have survived a cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular arrhythmia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The PRAETORIAN trial was an international, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing subcutaneous and transvenous ICDs in patients with class I or IIa indications for ICD therapy without pacing indications.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A total of 849 patients were included in the analysis, with 426 assigned to receive a subcutaneous ICD and 423 to receive a transvenous ICD.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a subcutaneous ICD or transvenous ICD according to 1:1 allocation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The primary endpoint was a composite of device-related complications and inappropriate shocks. Secondary endpoints included death, appropriate shocks, major adverse cardiac events, and hospitalization for heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The clinical-events committee was aware of the trial-group assignments, potentially introducing bias.
- Device technology advancements during the trial may affect applicability of results.
- Shorter experience with subcutaneous ICD implantation compared to transvenous ICD.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Boston Scientific.
