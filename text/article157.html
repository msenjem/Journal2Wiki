    "Clinical Question"<br/>
In patients with an indication for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) but no indication for pacing, is the subcutaneous ICD noninferior to the transvenous ICD with respect to device-related complications and inappropriate shocks?<br/>
<br/>
"Bottom Line"<br/>
The subcutaneous ICD was noninferior to the transvenous ICD regarding device-related complications and inappropriate shocks in patients requiring ICD implantation without pacing indications.<br/>
<br/>
"Major Points"<br/><br/>
<br/>
"Guidelines"<br/>
Current guidelines recommend ICD therapy for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in specific patient populations at high risk and for secondary prevention in patients who have survived a cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular arrhythmia.<br/>
<br/>
"Design"<br/><br/>
<br/>
"Population"<br/>
A total of 849 patients were included in the analysis, with 426 assigned to receive a subcutaneous ICD and 423 to receive a transvenous ICD.<br/>
<br/>
"Interventions"<br/>
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a subcutaneous ICD or transvenous ICD according to 1:1 allocation.<br/>
<br/>
"Outcomes"<br/>
The primary endpoint was a composite of device-related complications and inappropriate shocks. Secondary endpoints included death, appropriate shocks, major adverse cardiac events, and hospitalization for heart failure.<br/>
<br/>
"Criticisms"<br/>
- The clinical-events committee was aware of the trial-group assignments, potentially introducing bias.<br/>
- Device technology advancements during the trial may affect applicability of results.<br/>
- Shorter experience with subcutaneous ICD implantation compared to transvenous ICD.<br/>
<br/>
"Funding"<br/>
The trial was funded by Boston Scientific.<br/>
