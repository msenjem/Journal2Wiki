    "Dabigatran versus Warfarin in Patients with Mechanical Heart Valves".The New England Journal of Medicine. 2013. 369(13):1206-1214.PubMed•Full text•PDF<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Is dabigatran an effective and safe alternative to warfarin in patients with mechanical heart valves?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with mechanical heart valves, dabigatran was less effective than warfarin and was associated with a higher risk of both thromboembolic and bleeding complications.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines do not recommend dabigatran and other novel oral anticoagulants for patients with mechanical heart valves, generally favoring vitamin K antagonist therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Prospective, randomized, phase 2, open-label trial with blinded endpoint adjudication, comparing dabigatran to warfarin in patients with mechanical heart valves.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years who had either recent (within 7 days) or past (at least 3 months prior) aortic or mitral mechanical valve replacement.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients were randomized to receive dabigatran or warfarin in a 2:1 ratio. Dabigatran dose was selected based on renal function and adjusted for plasma levels, whereas warfarin dose was adjusted targeting an INR of 2 to 3 or 2.5 to 3.5.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
The primary endpoint was the trough plasma level of dabigatran, with secondary endpoints including stroke, systemic embolism, valve thrombosis, and major bleeding events.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
The trial was stopped early due to excess thromboembolic and bleeding events in the dabigatran group, which may have caused an underestimation of long-term efficacy and safety.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The trial was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim. <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Further Reading</strong></h2><br/>
Full details of the study design and results are available in the published article by The New England Journal of Medicine and additional supplementary material.
