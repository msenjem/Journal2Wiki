 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Nephrectomy followed by interferon therapy results in longer survival among patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer than does interferon therapy alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Southwest Oncology Group conducted a randomized trial to determine whether nephrectomy affects survival in metastatic renal-cell cancer. The trial compared nephrectomy followed by interferon alfa-2b therapy with interferon alfa-2b therapy alone and found that the median survival was 11.1 months in the nephrectomy group, compared to 8.1 months in the interferon-only group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As a result of this and related studies, nephrectomy followed by interferon therapy is considered a possible standard of care in metastatic renal-cell cancer, and should potentially be used in the control group of future phase 3 trials exploring treatments of this disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=241 eligible patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer and acceptable candidates for nephrectomy
- Randomization to radical nephrectomy plus interferon alfa-2b therapy or interferon alfa-2b therapy alone
- Mean follow-up: 368 days
- Primary endpoint: Overall survival
- Secondary endpoint: Response of tumor to treatment
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Confirmed diagnosis of metastatic renal-cell carcinoma
- Primary tumor considered resectable
- Performance status of 0 or 1 according to the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria
- No prior treatment with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biologic-response modifiers.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias
- History of other cancers within the last five years, with exceptions for certain treated skin cancers or in situ cervical cancer.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Radical nephrectomy through transabdominal, flank, or thoracoabdominal approach, followed by interferon alfa-2b therapy.
- Interferon alfa-2b therapy alone, without nephrectomy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes:
- Median survival: 11.1 months for nephrectomy group vs. 8.1 months for interferon-only group (P=0.05)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Secondary Outcome:
- Response rates to interferon therapy were low and similar in both groups (3.3% partial responses in the nephrectomy group vs. 3.6% complete/partial/unconfirmed responses in the interferon-only group).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The reasons nephrectomy prior to systemic treatment may be beneficial are not well understood.
- Some argue the operative morbidity and mortality associated with nephrectomy may offset potential benefits, although this study showed low rates of complications.
- The study was not designed to evaluate which patients might most benefit from surgery.
