    "Nephrectomy Plus Interferon Alfa-2b versus Interferon Alfa-2b Alone in Metastatic Renal-Cell Cancer"<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does nephrectomy followed by interferon therapy result in longer survival than interferon therapy alone in patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Nephrectomy followed by interferon therapy results in longer survival among patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer than does interferon therapy alone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
The Southwest Oncology Group conducted a randomized trial to determine whether nephrectomy affects survival in metastatic renal-cell cancer. The trial compared nephrectomy followed by interferon alfa-2b therapy with interferon alfa-2b therapy alone and found that the median survival was 11.1 months in the nephrectomy group, compared to 8.1 months in the interferon-only group.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As a result of this and related studies, nephrectomy followed by interferon therapy is considered a possible standard of care in metastatic renal-cell cancer, and should potentially be used in the control group of future phase 3 trials exploring treatments of this disease.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial<br/>
- N=241 eligible patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer and acceptable candidates for nephrectomy<br/>
- Randomization to radical nephrectomy plus interferon alfa-2b therapy or interferon alfa-2b therapy alone<br/>
- Mean follow-up: 368 days<br/>
- Primary endpoint: Overall survival<br/>
- Secondary endpoint: Response of tumor to treatment<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Confirmed diagnosis of metastatic renal-cell carcinoma<br/>
- Primary tumor considered resectable<br/>
- Performance status of 0 or 1 according to the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria<br/>
- No prior treatment with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biologic-response modifiers.<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias<br/>
- History of other cancers within the last five years, with exceptions for certain treated skin cancers or in situ cervical cancer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Radical nephrectomy through transabdominal, flank, or thoracoabdominal approach, followed by interferon alfa-2b therapy.<br/>
- Interferon alfa-2b therapy alone, without nephrectomy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcomes:<br/>
- Median survival: 11.1 months for nephrectomy group vs. 8.1 months for interferon-only group (P=0.05)<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcome:<br/>
- Response rates to interferon therapy were low and similar in both groups (3.3% partial responses in the nephrectomy group vs. 3.6% complete/partial/unconfirmed responses in the interferon-only group).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The reasons nephrectomy prior to systemic treatment may be beneficial are not well understood.<br/>
- Some argue the operative morbidity and mortality associated with nephrectomy may offset potential benefits, although this study showed low rates of complications.<br/>
- The study was not designed to evaluate which patients might most benefit from surgery.<br/>
