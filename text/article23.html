 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In high-risk patients with myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular systolic dysfunction, heart failure, or both, how does the efficacy of valsartan, captopril, or the combination of both compare in terms of mortality?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Valsartan is as effective as captopril for improving survival and reducing cardiovascular morbidity in high-risk patients following myocardial infarction. The combination of valsartan and captopril does not improve survival and increases the rate of adverse events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">ACE inhibitors like captopril have established benefits post-myocardial infarction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, or both. The Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction (VALIANT) trial compared the angiotensin-receptor blocker valsartan, the ACE inhibitor captopril, and their combination, finding that valsartan is as effective as captopril in high-risk post-myocardial infarction patients regarding mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. Combining valsartan with captopril did not improve survival and increased the rate of adverse events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">International guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors as first-line therapy for patients with myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomized, double-blind trial
- N=14,703
- Valsartan (n=4909)
- Valsartan plus captopril (n=4885)
- Captopril (n=4909)
- Median follow-up: 24.7 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age ≥18 years
- Acute myocardial infarction (0.5 to 10 days before)
- Complicated by heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤0.35 or ≤0.40 depending on ventriculography method), or both
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Intolerance or contraindication to ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers
- Significant valvular disease or other severely limiting diseases
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Similar across all groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Valsartan initiated at 20 mg, goal to reach 160 mg twice daily
- Valsartan + captopril initiated at combined doses, goal to reach valsartan 80 mg twice daily and captopril 50 mg three times daily
- Captopril initiated at 6.25 mg, goal to reach 50 mg three times daily
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Similar mortality rates across all groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Rates of secondary composite cardiovascular outcomes were similar across groups
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Noninferiority
- Valsartan demonstrated noninferiority to captopril regarding mortality
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Tolerability and Safety
- The combination group experienced the most drug-related adverse events
- With monotherapy, valsartan associated with more hypotension and renal dysfunction, while captopril associated with cough, rash, and taste disturbance
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Discussion
The VALIANT trial's findings indicate valsartan as a clinically effective alternative to captopril in high-risk patients post-myocardial infarction. The choice between these two treatments may depend on clinical experience, tolerability, safety, convenience, and cost.
