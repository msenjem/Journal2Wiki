                                        </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera, does maintaining a hematocrit below 45% reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and major thrombosis compared to a higher hematocrit target?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera, maintaining a hematocrit target below 45% results in a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular death and major thrombosis compared to a target of 45 to 50%.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Previous recommendations for managing polycythemia vera suggested maintaining a hematocrit level below 45% to reduce thrombotic risk, but evidence from randomized clinical trials was lacking. The CYTO-PV study compared the standard hematocrit target of less than 45% with a level of 45 to 50% in JAK2-positive polycythemia vera patients treated with phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, or both.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Based on this study's findings, it is recommended that the hematocrit be maintained below 45% in patients with polycythemia vera to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and major thrombotic events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial
- N=365 adults with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera
- Low-hematocrit group (n=182) with a hematocrit target of less than 45%
- High-hematocrit group (n=183) with a hematocrit target of 45 to 50%
- Median follow-up: 31 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Adults with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera, per WHO 2008 diagnostic criteria
- Exclusion Criteria: Significant liver or renal disease, substance/alcohol abuse, pregnancy, life-threatening conditions, history of adverse reactions to hydroxyurea
- Baseline demographics were well-balanced between groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients were assigned to receive phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, or both for targeted hematocrit management.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcome: Time until death from cardiovascular causes or a major thrombotic event
- Secondary outcome: Total rate of cardiovascular events
- Additional outcomes: Incidence of cancer, progression to myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia, leukemic transformation, and hemorrhage
- Primary outcome observed in 2.7% of the low-hematocrit group vs. 9.8% of the high-hematocrit group (hazard ratio 3.91; P=0.007)
- No significant difference in adverse events between groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Although halted before the planned endpoint due to recruitment challenges, the study results provided unexpected evidence for the benefit of intensive hematocrit reduction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) and Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancroâ€“Gruppo Italiano Malattie Mieloproliferative (AIRC-GIMEMA).
