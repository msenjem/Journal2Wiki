 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among adults receiving standard-of-care antibiotics for C. difficile infection, bezlotoxumab decreased the recurrence of infection and had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Actoxumab, an antibody against toxin A, provided no additional benefit when used with bezlotoxumab.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Clostridium difficile infection is a significant cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients, and recurrence of infection is common post-antibiotic treatment. Bezlotoxumab, a human monoclonal antibody against C. difficile toxin B, was evaluated for its efficacy in preventing recurrence when administered alongside standard antibiotics.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the latest update, no guidelines have been published that reflect the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- MODIFY I and MODIFY II: Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials.
- N=2,655 adults with primary or recurrent C. difficile infection.
- Intervention groups: bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg), actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg each), placebo; actoxumab alone given in MODIFY I but discontinued after an interim analysis.
- Setting: 322 sites in 30 countries.
- Enrollment: November 1, 2011, through May 22, 2015.
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat.
- Primary efficacy outcome: recurrent infection within 12 weeks after infusion in the modified intention-to-treat population.
- Safety outcome: adverse events during a 12-week follow-up period.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adults with primary or recurrent C. difficile infection receiving oral standard-of-care antibiotics.
- Inclusion criteria: Diarrhea with a positive stool test for toxigenic C. difficile.
- Exclusion criteria: Symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) ≥15 PVCs per hour at a rate of ≥120 bpm.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Participants were stratified according to standard-of-care antibiotics and hospitalization status.
- Randomly assigned to receive a single infusion of bezlotoxumab, actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab, placebo, or actoxumab alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Recurrent C. difficile infection rate was significantly lower with bezlotoxumab alone (17% in MODIFY I, 16% in MODIFY II) and with actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab (16% in MODIFY I, 15% in MODIFY II) than with placebo (28%).
- Initial clinical cure rates were 80% with bezlotoxumab alone and actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab, and 80% with placebo; sustained cure rates were 64%, 58%, and 54%, respectively.
- Adverse events were similar across the groups, with diarrhea and nausea being the most common.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Standard-of-care antibiotic selection was not standardized.
- Efficacy of bezlotoxumab unaffected by choice of standard-of-care antibiotic.
- Assessed time from infusion to onset of symptoms was broad, limiting the assessment of antitoxin effect on severity and duration of baseline episode.
- Potentially serious but low-frequency toxic effects difficult to detect due to relatively small number of patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by Merck.
