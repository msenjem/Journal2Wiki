    "Bezlotoxumab for Prevention of Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection"<br/>

<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does bezlotoxumab, a monoclonal antibody against Clostridium difficile toxin B, reduce the recurrence of C. difficile infection in adults receiving antibiotics for primary or recurrent infection?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Among adults receiving standard-of-care antibiotics for C. difficile infection, bezlotoxumab decreased the recurrence of infection and had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Actoxumab, an antibody against toxin A, provided no additional benefit when used with bezlotoxumab.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Clostridium difficile infection is a significant cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients, and recurrence of infection is common post-antibiotic treatment. Bezlotoxumab, a human monoclonal antibody against C. difficile toxin B, was evaluated for its efficacy in preventing recurrence when administered alongside standard antibiotics.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of the latest update, no guidelines have been published that reflect the results of this trial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- MODIFY I and MODIFY II: Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials.<br/>
- N=2,655 adults with primary or recurrent C. difficile infection.<br/>
- Intervention groups: bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg), actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg each), placebo; actoxumab alone given in MODIFY I but discontinued after an interim analysis.<br/>
- Setting: 322 sites in 30 countries.<br/>
- Enrollment: November 1, 2011, through May 22, 2015.<br/>
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat.<br/>
- Primary efficacy outcome: recurrent infection within 12 weeks after infusion in the modified intention-to-treat population.<br/>
- Safety outcome: adverse events during a 12-week follow-up period.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Adults with primary or recurrent C. difficile infection receiving oral standard-of-care antibiotics.<br/>
- Inclusion criteria: Diarrhea with a positive stool test for toxigenic C. difficile.<br/>
- Exclusion criteria: Symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) ≥15 PVCs per hour at a rate of ≥120 bpm.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Participants were stratified according to standard-of-care antibiotics and hospitalization status.<br/>
- Randomly assigned to receive a single infusion of bezlotoxumab, actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab, placebo, or actoxumab alone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Recurrent C. difficile infection rate was significantly lower with bezlotoxumab alone (17% in MODIFY I, 16% in MODIFY II) and with actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab (16% in MODIFY I, 15% in MODIFY II) than with placebo (28%).<br/>
- Initial clinical cure rates were 80% with bezlotoxumab alone and actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab, and 80% with placebo; sustained cure rates were 64%, 58%, and 54%, respectively.<br/>
- Adverse events were similar across the groups, with diarrhea and nausea being the most common.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Standard-of-care antibiotic selection was not standardized.<br/>
- Efficacy of bezlotoxumab unaffected by choice of standard-of-care antibiotic.<br/>
- Assessed time from infusion to onset of symptoms was broad, limiting the assessment of antitoxin effect on severity and duration of baseline episode.<br/>
- Potentially serious but low-frequency toxic effects difficult to detect due to relatively small number of patients.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The study was funded by Merck.<br/>
