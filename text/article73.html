 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with stable coronary artery disease and myocardial ischemia, does management with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in addition to optimal medical therapy reduce the risk of cardiovascular events compared to optimal medical therapy alone?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with stable coronary artery disease, an initial management strategy of PCI combined with optimal medical therapy did not reduce the risk of death, myocardial infarction, or other major cardiovascular events when compared to optimal medical therapy alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial was designed to assess the efficacy of PCI with optimal medical therapy versus optimal medical therapy alone in stable coronary artery disease. The trial showed that PCI did not reduce the rates of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or other major cardiovascular events. The trial supports the practice of initially using optimal medical therapy in patients with stable coronary artery disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend that optimal medical therapy should be the initial treatment approach for patients with stable coronary artery disease, reserving revascularization for symptom control or the development of an acute coronary syndrome.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N=2,287 patients with stable coronary artery disease
- PCI with optimal medical therapy (n=1,149)
- Optimal medical therapy alone (n=1,138)
- Enrollment: 1999 to 2004
- Median follow-up: 4.6 years
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Documented myocardial ischemia and significant coronary artery disease
- Exclusion Criteria: Persistent severe angina, ejection fraction <30%, revascularization within previous 6 months, unsuitable coronary anatomy for PCI
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients randomized to either undergo PCI with optimal medical therapy or to receive optimal medical therapy alone
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause and nonfatal myocardial infarction, which occurred in 19.0% of the PCI group and 18.5% of the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio 1.05; P=0.62)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Secondary Outcome
- There were no significant differences between groups in a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke (20.0% vs. 19.5%; hazard ratio, 1.05; P=0.62); hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (12.4% vs. 11.8%; P=0.56); or myocardial infarction (13.2% vs. 12.3%; P=0.33)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The majority of patients were male (85%), limiting generalizability
- Lack of ethnic diversity (14% nonwhite)
- Predominant use of bare-metal stents; drug-eluting stents were available only in the final months of the study
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and additional funding from multiple pharmaceutical companies through unrestricted grants
