 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among patients with atrial fibrillation at increased stroke risk that are unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy, does the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin reduce the risk of vascular events?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with atrial fibrillation unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy and at increased risk for stroke, adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduced the risk of major vascular events, particularly stroke, but increased the risk of major hemorrhage.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke by fivefold, and adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and antiplatelet agents both reduce this risk, though VKAs are recommended for higher-risk patients. However, VKAs require regular monitoring and are unsuitable for many patients, who generally receive aspirin instead. The ACTIVE A trial evaluated the effect of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in atrial fibrillation patients at an increased risk for stroke for whom VKA therapy was unsuitable.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">No specific guidelines were cited by the trial, but it was noted that VKAs are typically recommended for patients at a higher risk of stroke and aspirin for those at lower risk.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=7,554
- Clopidogrel (n=3,772) vs placebo (n=3,782), plus aspirin for all patients
- Median follow-up: 3.6 years
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, non-CNS systemic embolism, or death from vascular causes
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Atrial fibrillation at enrollment or had at least two episodes in the previous 6 months
- At least one risk factor for stroke (age â‰¥75, hypertension, previous stroke/TIA/systemic embolism, left ventricular ejection fraction <45%, peripheral artery disease, or age 55-74 plus diabetes or CAD)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Required VKA or antiplatelet therapy, documented peptic ulcer disease within 6 months, history of intracerebral hemorrhage, significant thrombocytopenia, ongoing alcohol abuse
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age: 71 years
- 58.2% male
- Atrial fibrillation status: 63.7% permanent, 22.1% paroxysmal, 14.0% persistent
- Mean CHADS2 score: 2.0
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 75 mg/day of clopidogrel or matching placebo, in addition to recommended aspirin dose (75-100 mg/day)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Primary composite outcome occurred in 832 patients receiving clopidogrel (6.8% per year) vs 924 patients receiving placebo (7.6% per year) [RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.81-0.98; P=0.01]
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Stroke: 296 patients with clopidogrel (2.4% per year) vs 408 placebo (3.3% per year) [RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.62-0.83; P<0.001]
- Myocardial infarction: 90 patients with clopidogrel (0.7% per year) vs 115 placebo (0.9% per year) [RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.59-1.03; P=0.08]
- Major bleeding: 251 patients with clopidogrel (2.0% per year) vs 162 placebo (1.3% per year) [RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.29-1.92; P<0.001]
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- ACTIVE A used a relatively high dose of aspirin as the control, which may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.
- The trial has limited applicability to patients who are not at such a high risk of bleeding or who are capable of taking VKAs.
  
Funding
- Funded by grants from Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb
- Authors disclosed various personal fees from these and other pharmaceutical companies
