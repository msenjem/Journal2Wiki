<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does early revascularization improve survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Early revascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock did not significantly reduce overall 30-day mortality but did result in a significant survival benefit at six months.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction. Previous studies suggested that revascularization could improve outcomes, but these were non-randomized and potentially biased. This randomized controlled trial did not find a significant reduction in 30-day mortality with emergency revascularization compared to initial medical stabilization. However, revascularization did result in a significant survival benefit after six months, suggesting early revascularization should be strongly considered for these patients.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Contemporary guidelines recommend early revascularization for patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction, based on this trial's longer-term survival benefits.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized trial.<br/>
- N=302 patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.<br/>
- Emergency revascularization: 152 patients.<br/>
- Initial medical stabilization: 150 patients.<br/>
- Inclusion criteria included ST-segment elevation, Q-wave infarction, new left bundle-branch block, or posterior infarction with anterior ST-segment depression, plus shock due to left ventricular failure.<br/>
- Exclusion criteria included severe systemic illness, other causes of shock, severe valvular disease, and unsuitability for revascularization.<br/>
- Primary endpoint: Mortality at 30 days.<br/>
- Secondary endpoint: Six-month survival.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Mean age: 66±10 years.<br/>
- 32% women.<br/>
- 55% transferred from other hospitals.<br/>
<br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
- Recent MI with ST-segment elevation, new Q-wave, new left bundle-branch block, or anterior ST depression with posterior MI.<br/>
- Cardiogenic shock confirmed by clinical and hemodynamic criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
- Severe concurrent illness.<br/>
- Non-cardiogenic shock.<br/>
- Severe valvular disease.<br/>
- Ineligibility for revascularization.<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
- Similar between revascularization and medical therapy groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Revascularization: Urgent coronary angiography followed by angioplasty or bypass surgery.<br/>
- Medical stabilization: Intensive medical therapy, recommended thrombolytic therapy, and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
- 30-day mortality: 46.7% for revascularization group, 56.0% for medical therapy group (P=0.11).<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Six-month mortality: Significantly lower in the revascularization group (50.3%) compared to the medical therapy group (63.1%) (P=0.027).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The study was designed to detect a 20% absolute mortality difference at 30 days; not powered for smaller differences.<br/>
- The small number of very early randomizations precludes inferences about benefits of very early revascularization.<br/>
- Small number of elderly patients included limits conclusions for this subgroup.<br/>
