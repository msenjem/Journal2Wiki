 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early application of prolonged prone-positioning sessions significantly decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality in patients with severe ARDS.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prone positioning has long been used to improve oxygenation in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, but previous trials failed to show survival benefits. This study demonstrated a lower mortality rate at both 28 days and 90 days in patients with ARDS and severe hypoxemia who received early application of prone positioning.

 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial
N=466 patients with severe ARDS
Prone group (n=237)
Supine group (n=229)
Setting: 26 ICUs in France and 1 in Spain
Enrollment: January 1, 2008, to July 25, 2011
Analysis: Intention-to-treat
Follow-up: 90 days
Primary outcome: Mortality at day 28
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Adults with ARDS as defined by the American–European Consensus Conference criteria
- Mechanical ventilation for ARDS for less than 36 hours
- Severe ARDS (PaO2:FiO2 ratio of <150 mm Hg, FiO2 ≥0.6, PEEP ≥5 cm H2O, tidal volume close to 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
See the Supplementary Appendix of the full text article
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics:
- Similar between groups, except for SOFA score and use of neuromuscular blockers and vasopressors.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Prone group: Prone positioning within one hour after randomization for at least 16 consecutive hours
- Supine group: Patients remained in semirecumbent position
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome:
- 28-day mortality: 16.0% in the prone group vs. 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001)
Secondary Outcomes:
- 90-day mortality: 23.6% in the prone group vs. 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001)
- Higher rate of successful extubation in the prone group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Skilled units were utilized, limiting generalizability to centers without such expertise.
- Potential imbalance due to baselines differences in SOFA score, vasopressor use, and neuromuscular blocker use.
- Higher mortality in the control group could be argued, though mortality rates were consistent with recent trials.
