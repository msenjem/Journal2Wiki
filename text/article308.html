 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and good performance status, how does FOLFIRINOX compare with gemcitabine in terms of efficacy and safety?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">FOLFIRINOX compared with gemcitabine significantly prolongs survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have good performance status, though with increased toxicity.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">FOLFIRINOX, a regimen consisting of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin, was associated with a significant improvement in survival over gemcitabine, the standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer, in this study. FOLFIRINOX resulted in a higher response rate and improved progression-free survival but exhibited higher toxicity.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of my knowledge cutoff date in 2023, current oncology guidelines may consider FOLFIRINOX a first-line treatment option for selected patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and good performance status. However, newer data may have emerged since then.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, phase 2-3 trial
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">342 patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that had not been previously treated with chemotherapy.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age 18 years or older
- Histologically and cytologically confirmed, measurable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
- ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1
- Adequate bone marrow, liver function, and renal function
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Age of 76 years or older
- Non-adenocarcinoma pancreatic cancers
- Prior radiation for measurable lesions
- Cerebral metastases
- History of another major cancer
- Active infection
- Chronic diarrhea
- Clinically significant cardiac disease
- Pregnancy or breast-feeding
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Median age: 61 years
- Male: 56%
- Metastases: liver (84%), lung (23%)
- Performance status 0: 60%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- FOLFIRINOX: oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin every 2 weeks
- Gemcitabine: weekly for 7 of 8 weeks and then weekly for 3 of 4 weeks
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Overall survival: 11.1 months with FOLFIRINOX vs 6.8 months with gemcitabine (P<0.001)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Progression-free survival: 6.4 months with FOLFIRINOX vs 3.3 months with gemcitabine (P<0.001)
- Response rate: 31.6% with FOLFIRINOX vs 9.4% with gemcitabine (P<0.001)
- Increased toxicity with FOLFIRINOX, including neutropenia and febrile neutropenia
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Increased toxicity associated with FOLFIRINOX may limit its use.
- The selection of patients with good performance status may not be representative of the general population with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by the French Ministry of Health, Amgen, and the French National League against Cancer, with drug donations from Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer.
