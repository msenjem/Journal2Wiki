 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Cryoballoon ablation was noninferior to radiofrequency ablation with respect to treatment efficacy in patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and there was no significant difference in the overall safety profile between the two methods.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Both cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation are used for pulmonary-vein isolation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. This multicenter, randomized trial compared these two methods to determine their efficacy and safety in treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend catheter ablation with pulmonary-vein isolation as a class I level A indication for drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, noninferiority, parallel-group, open-label trial with blinded endpoint assessment.
- N=762 patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
- Interventions: Cryoballoon ablation (n=378) or radiofrequency ablation (n=384).
- Follow-up: Mean period of 1.5 years.
- Primary efficacy endpoint: First documented clinical failure (recurrence of AF, occurrence of atrial flutter or tachycardia, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, or repeat ablation) after a 90-day post-ablation blanking period.
- Primary safety endpoint: Composite of death, cerebrovascular events, or serious treatment-related adverse events.
  
Population
- 16 centers in 8 countries participated.
- Patients aged â‰¥18 years with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was refractory to class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs or beta blockers were eligible.
  
Interventions
- Cryoballoon ablation: Attempted pulmonary-vein isolation using a cryoballoon filled with liquid refrigerant to cool and ablate tissue.
- Radiofrequency ablation: Attempted pulmonary-vein isolation with point-by-point applications of radiofrequency energy, using electroanatomical navigation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 138 patients in the cryoballoon group and 143 in the radiofrequency group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.22; P<0.001 for noninferiority).
- Primary safety endpoint occurred in 40 patients in the cryoballoon group and in 51 patients in the radiofrequency group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.18; P=0.24).
- The mean total procedure time was shorter for cryoballoon ablation, whereas the mean total fluoroscopy time was shorter for radiofrequency ablation.
- No significant difference in time to first rehospitalization for cardiovascular causes between the groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open-label design may introduce bias.
- Complete isolation was not achieved in all patients.
- Some utilized catheters were of the first generation, potentially affecting outcomes relative to newer-generation catheters.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Medtronic.
