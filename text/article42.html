    "Cryoballoon or Radiofrequency Ablation for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation".<br/>
The New England Journal of Medicine. 2016.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In symptomatic patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, is cryoballoon ablation noninferior to radiofrequency ablation in terms of efficacy and safety?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Cryoballoon ablation was noninferior to radiofrequency ablation with respect to treatment efficacy in patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and there was no significant difference in the overall safety profile between the two methods.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Both cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation are used for pulmonary-vein isolation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. This multicenter, randomized trial compared these two methods to determine their efficacy and safety in treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines recommend catheter ablation with pulmonary-vein isolation as a class I level A indication for drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, noninferiority, parallel-group, open-label trial with blinded endpoint assessment.<br/>
- N=762 patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.<br/>
- Interventions: Cryoballoon ablation (n=378) or radiofrequency ablation (n=384).<br/>
- Follow-up: Mean period of 1.5 years.<br/>
- Primary efficacy endpoint: First documented clinical failure (recurrence of AF, occurrence of atrial flutter or tachycardia, use of antiarrhythmic drugs, or repeat ablation) after a 90-day post-ablation blanking period.<br/>
- Primary safety endpoint: Composite of death, cerebrovascular events, or serious treatment-related adverse events.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- 16 centers in 8 countries participated.<br/>
- Patients aged â‰¥18 years with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was refractory to class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs or beta blockers were eligible.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Cryoballoon ablation: Attempted pulmonary-vein isolation using a cryoballoon filled with liquid refrigerant to cool and ablate tissue.<br/>
- Radiofrequency ablation: Attempted pulmonary-vein isolation with point-by-point applications of radiofrequency energy, using electroanatomical navigation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 138 patients in the cryoballoon group and 143 in the radiofrequency group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.22; P&lt;0.001 for noninferiority).<br/>
- Primary safety endpoint occurred in 40 patients in the cryoballoon group and in 51 patients in the radiofrequency group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.18; P=0.24).<br/>
- The mean total procedure time was shorter for cryoballoon ablation, whereas the mean total fluoroscopy time was shorter for radiofrequency ablation.<br/>
- No significant difference in time to first rehospitalization for cardiovascular causes between the groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Open-label design may introduce bias.<br/>
- Complete isolation was not achieved in all patients.<br/>
- Some utilized catheters were of the first generation, potentially affecting outcomes relative to newer-generation catheters.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The trial was funded by Medtronic.<br/>
