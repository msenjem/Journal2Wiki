 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with previously untreated advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells, how does pembrolizumab compare with platinum-based chemotherapy?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In previously untreated advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells, pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free and overall survival with fewer adverse events compared to platinum-based chemotherapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Advanced NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression often have limited treatment options beyond chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, has shown promising results in such patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">This study may influence guidelines to consider pembrolizumab for first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Open-label, phase 3 randomized controlled trial.
N=305 patients.
Pembrolizumab vs. investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">305 patients with untreated, stage IV NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on ≥50% tumor cells.
Inclusion Criteria: Aged ≥18 years, ECOG performance-status score 0 or 1, and life expectancy ≥3 months. No sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK translocations.
Exclusion Criteria: Systemic glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive treatment, untreated brain metastases, active autoimmune disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis history.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks for 35 cycles) vs. investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy (4 to 6 cycles).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: Progression-free survival assessed by central radiologic review.
Secondary Outcomes: Overall survival, objective response rate, safety.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Open-label design could introduce bias. Low number of deaths and confounding effect of crossover design. Limited generalizability to patients with low PD-L1 expression.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Merck, the developer of pembrolizumab.
