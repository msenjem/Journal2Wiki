 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early initiation of renal-replacement therapy in septic shock patients with severe AKI showed no significant difference in 90-day mortality compared to a strategy in which renal-replacement therapy was delayed for 48 hours.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The optimal timing for initiating renal-replacement therapy in the setting of septic shock associated with AKI remains uncertain. While immediate initiation is indicated during life-threatening complications related to AKI, such as hyperkalemia or metabolic acidosis, the benefits of early initiation in the absence of such complications are unclear. The IDEAL-ICU trial aimed to determine if early initiation of renal-replacement therapy would improve 90-day mortality compared to a strategy in which initiation was delayed.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">The IDEAL-ICU trial was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial including patients with severe AKI in the early stages of septic shock. The trial compared mortality rates between those receiving renal-replacement therapy within 12 hours of documented AKI and those in whom therapy was delayed by 48 hours if spontaneous recovery had not occurred. The trial found no mortality benefit at 90 days with early initiation versus a delayed strategy, prompting early termination due to futility. In the delayed-strategy group, 38% of patients did not receive renal-replacement therapy due to spontaneous recovery of renal function.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the completion of the IDEAL-ICU trial, no definitive guidelines had been established for the specific timing of renal-replacement therapy initiation in septic shock patients based on these results.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial
N=488 patients with early-stage septic shock and severe AKI
Early initiation of renal-replacement therapy within 12 hours (n=239)
Delayed initiation after 48 hours without recovery (n=238)
Mean follow-up: 90 days
Primary outcome: All-cause mortality at 90 days
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Patients â‰¥18 years old within 48 hours of septic shock and vasopressor therapy onset, with severe AKI classified as "failure" stage by RIFLE criteria
Exclusion Criteria: Immediate need for emergency renal-replacement therapy before randomization
Baseline Characteristics: Comparable between both groups concerning demographics and clinical parameters
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early strategy: Renal-replacement initiated within 12 hours after AKI documentation
Delayed strategy: Initiated after 48 hours delay if no spontaneous recovery and no emergency criteria developed
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: No significant difference in mortality at 90 days (early: 58%, delayed: 54%, P=0.38)
Secondary Outcomes: No significant differences in secondary outcomes, including 28-day and 180-day mortality, days free of renal-replacement therapy, and length of stay in ICU or hospital
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The adoption of the RIFLE classification which may not be as sensitive as KDIGO classification for identifying patients with AKI.
- A delayed strategy of only 48 hours may not be long enough to determine clear differences between early and delayed initiation of renal-replacement therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by the French Ministry of Health.
