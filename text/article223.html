 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients 70 years of age or younger with previously untreated CLL, ibrutinib-rituximab therapy led to superior progression-free survival and overall survival compared with chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab has been the standard first-line treatment for younger, fit patients with CLL. Ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, has shown efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory and untreated CLL. This phase 3 trial demonstrated that ibrutinib in combination with rituximab was superior to standard chemoimmunotherapy in progression-free and overall survival in previously untreated patients younger than 70 years old with CLL.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines for CLL treatment reflect earlier data and may not yet include the combination of ibrutinib and rituximab as a frontline therapy in fit patients aged 70 or younger. These guidelines will likely be updated following the publication of this trial's results.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial
- N=529
- Ibrutinib-rituximab (n=354)
- Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab (FCR) (n=175)
- Median follow-up: 33.6 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Previously untreated patients with CLL/SLL, ≤70 years old, appropriate for FCR treatment, no chromosome 17p13 deletion
- Exclusion Criteria: Details within Supplementary Appendix
- Baseline Characteristics: Median age 58 years, majority were male, Rai stage I-II in majority
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Ibrutinib-rituximab: Ibrutinib (420 mg/day) until disease progression + rituximab for 6 cycles
- Chemoimmunotherapy: Fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab for 6 cycles
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Progression-free survival
  - 3-year survival: 89.4% ibrutinib-rituximab vs. 72.9% FCR, HR 0.35, 95% CI [0.22-0.56], P<0.001
- Secondary Outcome: Overall survival
  - 3-year survival: 98.8% ibrutinib-rituximab vs 91.5% FCR, HR 0.17, 95% CI [0.05-0.54], P<0.001
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Indefinite therapy with ibrutinib has potential long-term side effects and cost implications.
- FCR has a proven long-term efficacy, particularly in patients with IGHV-mutated CLL.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- National Cancer Institute and Pharmacyclics (a subsidiary of AbbVie).
