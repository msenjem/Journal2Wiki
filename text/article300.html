 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1) enhance antitumor activity and is it associated with acceptable safety in patients with advanced melanoma, non–small-cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, or renal-cell or colorectal cancer?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Blockade of PD-1 with the antibody BMS-936558 generated objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non–small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. The safety profile was considered acceptable, making the antibody a viable option for cancer treatment. PD-L1 expression on tumors may be a predictive marker for response to anti–PD-1 therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">This study observed significant antitumor activity with the use of anti–PD-1 antibody in the treatment of multiple advanced cancers, including non–small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal-cell cancer. Approximately 14% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events, with only 5% discontinuing treatment due to these events. Three deaths from pulmonary toxicity were reported.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">No guidelines were discussed in the article. This was an early phase clinical trial primarily assessing safety and preliminary efficacy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, phase 1 trial with open-label, dose-escalation, and cohort-expansion segments.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A total of 296 patients with advanced solid tumors were involved in the study, with diagnoses including melanoma, non–small-cell lung cancer, renal-cell cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
Patients had documented advanced solid tumors, were aged 18 years or older, had measurable disease, and adequate organ function.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
Patients with a history of chronic autoimmune disease, prior treatment with T cell-modulating antibodies, conditions requiring immunosuppressive medication, or chronic infections were excluded.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
The majority of patients were heavily pretreated, with 47% having received at least three prior regimens.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were given intravenous infusions of anti–PD-1 antibody (BMS-936558) every 2 weeks for each 8-week treatment cycle, up to a maximum of 12 cycles.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
Objective response rates (complete or partial response) were 18% in non–small-cell lung cancer, 28% in melanoma, and 27% in renal-cell cancer.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Safety and adverse event profiles, pharmacokinetics, and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells as a biomarker for response to therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was open-label and did not have a comparator arm. The predictive value of PD-L1 expression for treatment response needs further exploration, and selection bias may influence the results due to optional biopsies performed on a non-random subset of patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and other sources.
