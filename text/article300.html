<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1) enhance antitumor activity and is it associated with acceptable safety in patients with advanced melanoma, non–small-cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, or renal-cell or colorectal cancer?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Blockade of PD-1 with the antibody BMS-936558 generated objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non–small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. The safety profile was considered acceptable, making the antibody a viable option for cancer treatment. PD-L1 expression on tumors may be a predictive marker for response to anti–PD-1 therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
This study observed significant antitumor activity with the use of anti–PD-1 antibody in the treatment of multiple advanced cancers, including non–small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal-cell cancer. Approximately 14% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events, with only 5% discontinuing treatment due to these events. Three deaths from pulmonary toxicity were reported.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
No guidelines were discussed in the article. This was an early phase clinical trial primarily assessing safety and preliminary efficacy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, phase 1 trial with open-label, dose-escalation, and cohort-expansion segments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
A total of 296 patients with advanced solid tumors were involved in the study, with diagnoses including melanoma, non–small-cell lung cancer, renal-cell cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
Patients had documented advanced solid tumors, were aged 18 years or older, had measurable disease, and adequate organ function.<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
Patients with a history of chronic autoimmune disease, prior treatment with T cell-modulating antibodies, conditions requiring immunosuppressive medication, or chronic infections were excluded.<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
The majority of patients were heavily pretreated, with 47% having received at least three prior regimens.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients were given intravenous infusions of anti–PD-1 antibody (BMS-936558) every 2 weeks for each 8-week treatment cycle, up to a maximum of 12 cycles.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
Objective response rates (complete or partial response) were 18% in non–small-cell lung cancer, 28% in melanoma, and 27% in renal-cell cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
Safety and adverse event profiles, pharmacokinetics, and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells as a biomarker for response to therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
The study was open-label and did not have a comparator arm. The predictive value of PD-L1 expression for treatment response needs further exploration, and selection bias may influence the results due to optional biopsies performed on a non-random subset of patients.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and other sources.<br/>
