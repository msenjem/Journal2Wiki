 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with prior noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, is warfarin superior to aspirin in preventing recurrent ischemic stroke or death?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with prior noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, warfarin was not superior to aspirin in preventing recurrent ischemic stroke or death and both were considered reasonable therapeutic alternatives.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Warfarinâ€“Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study (WARSS) compared the efficacy of warfarin and aspirin for the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke or death in patients with a history of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The trial found no significant difference between the two treatments over a two-year period, presenting both as viable options for secondary stroke prevention.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of 2001, guidelines have not been updated to reflect the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial
- N=2,206 patients with recent ischemic stroke
- Warfarin (target INR 1.4 to 2.8)
- Aspirin (325 mg per day)
- Enrollment: 1993-2000
- Mean follow-up: 2 years
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Composite of recurrent ischemic stroke or death from any cause within two years
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age 30-85 years
- Acceptable candidates for warfarin therapy
- Had an ischemic stroke within the previous 30 days
- Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 3 or higher
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Baseline INR >1.4
- Stroke due to high-grade carotid stenosis planned for surgery
- Stroke associated with inferred cardioembolic source, e.g., atrial fibrillation
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Similar between both treatment groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Warfarin dose adjusted to maintain an INR 1.4 to 2.8
- Aspirin 325 mg daily
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- No significant difference in the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke or death between warfarin and aspirin (17.8% with warfarin vs. 16.0% with aspirin, P=0.25)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Rates of major hemorrhage were low and not significantly different between treatment groups
- Minor hemorrhages were more frequent in the warfarin group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The study did not have sufficient power to show differences in treatment effects among various clinically identified stroke subtypes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by a grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Medications and placebos were supplied by Dupont Pharmaceuticals and Bayer.
