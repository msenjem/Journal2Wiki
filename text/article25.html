    "Transcatheter versus Surgical Aortic-Valve Replacement in Intermediate-Risk Patients". The New England Journal of Medicine. 2016.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, is transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) comparable to surgical aortic-valve replacement with regard to survival and stroke risk?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In intermediate-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, TAVR was found to be noninferior to surgical aortic-valve replacement regarding the primary endpoint of death or disabling stroke for up to 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) 2 trial evaluated TAVR as compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients at intermediate risk of complications from surgery. TAVR demonstrated noninferiority in terms of mortality or disabling strokes at 2 years follow-up. The TAVR group experienced less acute kidney injury, severe bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation, but higher rates of major vascular complications and paravalvular leakage compared to the surgical group.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease have yet to be updated to reflect the findings of this trial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial<br/>
- N=2,032 intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis<br/>
- TAVR (n=1,011) vs. surgical replacement (n=1,021)<br/>
- Setting: 57 centers in the United States and Canada<br/>
- Enrollment: December 2011 to November 2013<br/>
- Mean follow-up: 2 years<br/>
- Primary outcome: Death from any cause or disabling stroke at 2 years<br/>
- Funding: Edwards Lifesciences<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Severe aortic stenosis with cardiac symptoms, STS risk score of â‰¥4.0%, or other factors leading to intermediate surgical risk.<br/>
- Exclusion Criteria: Risk of death within 30 days after surgery less than 4%, severe comorbidities, or concomitant conditions not encompassed in the STS risk model.<br/>
- Baseline Characteristics: Mean STS score of 5.8% in both groups, similar in demographic and clinical characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- TAVR with the balloon-expandable SAPIEN XT heart-valve system.<br/>
- Surgical aortic-valve replacement.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcome: No significant difference in the primary endpoint of death or disabling stroke at 2 years.<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes (at 2 years): TAVR resulted in larger aortic-valve areas, lower rates of acute kidney injury, severe bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. Surgery resulted in fewer major vascular complications and less paravalvular aortic regurgitation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Withdrawal rate after randomization was high, notably in the surgery group.<br/>
- The SAPIEN XT valve used is already succeeded by the next-generation SAPIEN 3 valve system.<br/>
- Long-term durability of bioprosthetic transcatheter valves remains undetermined beyond the timeframe of the study.<br/>
- Subclinical valve-leaflet thrombosis was not systematically evaluated.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The trial was funded by Edwards Lifesciences.<br/>
