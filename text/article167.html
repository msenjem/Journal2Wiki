 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Among patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), does mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes improve mortality compared to traditional tidal volumes?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">In patients with ALI and ARDS, mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes (6 ml/kg of predicted body weight) compared to traditional tidal volumes (12 ml/kg of predicted body weight) resulted in decreased mortality and increased the number of days without ventilator use.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Mechanical ventilation with tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml/kg is traditional but may worsen lung injury in patients with ALI and ARDS. This randomized trial tested whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve outcomes in these patients, finding that lower tidal volumes resulted in a 22% relative reduction in mortality and more ventilator-free days when compared with traditional volumes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend the use of lower tidal volume ventilation in patients with ALI and ARDS to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized trial comparing traditional ventilation with lower tidal volume ventilation in ALI/ARDS patients. Enrolled 861 patients, mean follow-up of 180 days.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Patients with ALI or ARDS who were intubated and mechanically ventilated, age ≥18 years.

 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Acute onset hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤300
- Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema on chest radiograph
- No clinical signs of elevated left atrial hypertension or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤18 mm Hg if measured
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Ventilated >36 hours prior to eligibility, pregnancy, increased intracranial pressure, neuromuscular disease, severe chronic respiratory disease, severe burn injurie, contraindications to full life support, etc.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Groups were well balanced
- Minute ventilation was slightly higher in the lower volume group (P=0.01)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Two groups were created:
- Traditional volumes starting at 12 ml/kg of predicted body weight with plateau pressure ≤50 cm of water

 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The number of days without nonpulmonary organ failure was higher in the lower tidal volume group
