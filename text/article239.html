 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with acute venous thromboembolism, dabigatran was found to be noninferior to warfarin in terms of preventing recurrent events, had a similar safety profile, and did not require laboratory monitoring.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Warfarin has been the mainstay therapy for venous thromboembolism but requires frequent INR monitoring and dietary restrictions. Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, may offer an easier-to-use alternative without needing routine blood coagulation testing.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">No guidelines were provided within this article.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, noninferiority trial comparing dabigatran with warfarin following initial parenteral anticoagulation therapy. Each patient received 6 months of treatment.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A total of 2,564 patients with acute venous thromboembolism:
- Inclusion criteria: Adults â‰¥18 years with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis of the legs or pulmonary embolism requiring 6 months of anticoagulation
- Exclusion criteria: Prolonged (>14 days) symptoms, hemodynamically unstable pulmonary embolism requiring thrombolysis, other indications for warfarin, recent unstable cardiovascular disease, high risk of bleeding, severe liver disease, creatinine clearance <30 ml/min, pregnancy or risk of pregnancy, and long-term antiplatelet therapy
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) after initial parenteral anticoagulation
- Warfarin (dose-adjusted to achieve INR 2.0-3.0) after initial parenteral anticoagulation
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcome: Frequency of recurrent symptomatic, objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism and related deaths over 6 months
- Safety end points: Bleeding episodes, acute coronary syndromes, other adverse events, liver function tests
- Dabigatran group had 30 events (2.4%) vs. 27 events (2.1%) in the warfarin group
- Hazard ratio for dabigatran was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.84), meeting criteria for noninferiority (P<0.001)
- Major bleeding: 20 cases (1.6%) in dabigatran group vs. 24 cases (1.9%) in warfarin group (hazard ratio 0.82; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.48)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- First dose of dabigatran was only given after initial parenteral anticoagulation therapy for a median of 9 days; no evidence for monotherapy use at the acute phase
- The study's population was predominantly white and had good renal function, limiting generalizability
