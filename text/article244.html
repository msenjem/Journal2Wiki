 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Is ATRA plus arsenic trioxide as effective as the standard ATRA plus chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with low-to-intermediate-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">For patients with low-to-intermediate-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia, ATRA plus arsenic trioxide is at least not inferior and may be superior to ATRA plus chemotherapy in terms of event-free survival and overall survival, with reduced hematologic toxicity but more hepatic toxicity.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has become highly curable with the standard treatment of ATRA and chemotherapy, but pilot studies suggested that arsenic trioxide with or without ATRA may lead to reduced hematologic toxicity and high efficacy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">There are no specific guidelines recommending ATRA plus arsenic trioxide over standard chemotherapy regimens based on this study alone as the knowledge cutoff for this summary does not include any guidelines published after this study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 noninferiority trial comparing ATRA-arsenic trioxide with standard ATRA-chemotherapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Patients aged 18 to 71 years with newly diagnosed, low-to-intermediate-risk APL (white-cell count, ≤10×10^9 per liter).
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Newly diagnosed APL classified as low-to-intermediate risk (white-cell count at diagnosis, ≤10×10^9 per liter)
- Confirmed genetic diagnosis of PML-RARA fusion gene by RT-PCR, t(15;17) translocation, or microspeckled PML pattern by immunofluorescence
- Aged 18 to 71 years
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- High-risk APL
- White-cell count greater than 10×10^9 per liter
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Comparable demographic, clinical, and biologic characteristics between the two treatment cohorts
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to receive ATRA plus arsenic trioxide for induction and consolidation therapy or standard ATRA-chemotherapy for induction, followed by consolidation and maintenance therapy with chemotherapy and ATRA.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Event-free survival at 2 years with fewer failures (no remissions, relapses, or deaths) in the ATRA-arsenic trioxide group compared to the ATRA-chemotherapy group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Higher overall survival in the ATRA-arsenic trioxide group
- Similar antileukemic efficacy
- More hepatic toxicity but less hematologic toxicity and fewer infections in ATRA-arsenic trioxide group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Funded by Associazione Italiana contro le Leucemie and others
