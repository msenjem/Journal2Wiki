 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Thrombectomy plus standard care resulted in better 90-day outcomes for disability and functional independence compared to standard care alone in patients with acute stroke who were treated 6 to 24 hours after last being known well and had a mismatch between clinical deficit and infarct volume.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Previous trials showed endovascular thrombectomy to be beneficial when performed within 6 hours post-acute stroke. The DAWN trial extended the potential therapeutic window for thrombectomy to 6-24 hours post-stroke in patients with a clinical-infarct mismatch, using advanced imaging to identify viable brain tissue.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Not addressed within the wiki's content.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial with a Bayesian adaptiveâ€“enrichment design and blinded endpoint assessment.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery who were last known well 6 to 24 hours prior and had a mismatch between the severity of clinical deficit and infarct volume.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to thrombectomy plus standard care (thrombectomy group) or standard care alone (control group).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The coprimary endpoints were the mean disability score on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale at 90 days and the rate of functional independence at 90 days. Secondary endpoints included early therapeutic response, infarct volume, and recanalization rates.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Variance in baseline characteristics between groups although sensitivity analyses confirmed the benefit of thrombectomy.
- Sample size limited the power of certain subgroup analyses.
- Frequency of general anesthesia in thrombectomy cases was only 10%.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Stryker Neurovascular.
