    "Thrombectomy 6 to 24 Hours after Stroke". The New England Journal of Medicine. 2017. <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question:</strong></h2><br/>
Does endovascular thrombectomy performed 6 to 24 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke improve outcomes in patients with a mismatch between the severity of the clinical deficit and the infarct volume?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></h2><br/>
Thrombectomy plus standard care resulted in better 90-day outcomes for disability and functional independence compared to standard care alone in patients with acute stroke who were treated 6 to 24 hours after last being known well and had a mismatch between clinical deficit and infarct volume.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points:</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines:</strong></h2><br/>
Not addressed within the wiki's content.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design:</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial with a Bayesian adaptiveâ€“enrichment design and blinded endpoint assessment.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population:</strong></h2><br/>
Patients with occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery who were last known well 6 to 24 hours prior and had a mismatch between the severity of clinical deficit and infarct volume.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions:</strong></h2><br/>
Patients were randomized to thrombectomy plus standard care (thrombectomy group) or standard care alone (control group).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes:</strong></h2><br/>
The coprimary endpoints were the mean disability score on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale at 90 days and the rate of functional independence at 90 days. Secondary endpoints included early therapeutic response, infarct volume, and recanalization rates.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms:</strong></h2><br/>
- Variance in baseline characteristics between groups although sensitivity analyses confirmed the benefit of thrombectomy.<br/>
- Sample size limited the power of certain subgroup analyses.<br/>
- Frequency of general anesthesia in thrombectomy cases was only 10%.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding:</strong></h2><br/>
The trial was funded by Stryker Neurovascular.<br/>
