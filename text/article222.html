<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Is a restrictive red-cell transfusion strategy noninferior to a liberal strategy with respect to clinical outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery at moderate-to-high risk for death?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were at moderate-to-high risk for death, a restrictive red-cell transfusion strategy was noninferior to a liberal strategy, resulting in fewer transfusions without increasing the risk of composite outcomes including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Cardiac surgery patients have been among the highest recipients of red-cell transfusion. There has been uncertainty regarding the safety of restrictive transfusion strategies in cardiac surgery due to potential anemia-induced tissue hypoxia in already high-risk patients. The Transfusion Requirements in Cardiac Surgery (TRICS) III trial showed that in adults undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, a restrictive transfusion therapy (transfusion if hemoglobin &lt;7.5 g/dL) was noninferior to a liberal strategy (transfusion if hemoglobin &lt;9.5 g/dL in OR/ICU or &lt;8.5 g/dL in a non-ICU ward).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of the knowledge cut-off date, no specific updated guidelines have been released that reflect the results of this trial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
5,243 adults (age ≥18 years) undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass who had a EuroSCORE I of 6 or more.<br/>
<br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
- Scheduled for cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass<br/>
- Predicted preoperative risk of death with EuroSCORE I ≥6<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
- Unable to receive blood products<br/>
- Declined blood products<br/>
- Involved in preoperative autologous donation<br/>
- Undergoing heart transplantation or ventricular assist device insertion<br/>
- Pregnant or lactating<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
- Mean age: 72±10 years<br/>
- 35.4% females<br/>
- Mean EuroSCORE I: 7.8±1.9<br/>
- Type of surgery: CABG only (26.1%), CABG plus another procedure (27.7%), non-CABG procedure (46.2%)<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Randomized to restrictive (n=2,430) or liberal (n=2,430) red-cell transfusion strategies, from anesthesia induction to hospital discharge or day 28 post-surgery.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcomes<br/>
- Composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis by hospital discharge or by day 28 (whichever came first).<br/>
- Occurred in 11.4% of restrictive group vs. 12.5% of liberal group (odds ratio, 0.90; p&lt;0.001 for noninferiority).<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Red-cell transfusion occurred in 52.3% of restrictive group vs. 72.6% of liberal group (odds ratio, 0.41, p&lt;0.001).<br/>
- No significant differences in other secondary outcomes between groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Non-blinded design may introduce bias in outcome reporting.<br/>
- The restrictive group achieved a hemoglobin concentration on average 1 g/dL less than the liberal group during the study, which was less than the difference in transfusion triggers.<br/>
- Excluded low-risk patients, and did not test efficacy of transfusion or whether lower transfusion thresholds might be safe.<br/>
- Did not include patients with acute coronary artery disease.<br/>
