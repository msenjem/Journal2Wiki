    "Closure or Medical Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke with Patent Foramen Ovale". The New England Journal of Medicine. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00201461.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does closure with a percutaneous device reduce the risk of recurrent stroke or TIA in patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA and patent foramen ovale, compared to medical therapy alone?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA who also have a patent foramen ovale, closure with a device did not result in a greater benefit than medical therapy alone in preventing recurrent stroke or TIA.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
At the time of the study, closure of PFO with a percutaneous transcatheter device was an investigational procedure by the FDA. Many patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO were treated off-label.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-group superiority trial.<br/>
- Participants: 909 patients, aged 18-60, with cryptogenic stroke or TIA and PFO.<br/>
- Interventions: Closure with STARFlex device plus antiplatelet therapy (n=447) vs medical therapy alone (n=462).<br/>
- 2 years of follow-up.<br/>
- Primary outcome: Composite of stroke or TIA, any death within 30 days, or death from neurologic causes between 31 days and 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion criteria: Patients 18-60 years, had ischemic stroke or TIA within 6 months, evidence of PFO.<br/>
- Exclusion criteria: Identified potential causes of ischemic stroke or TIA other than PFO.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Percutaneous closure of PFO with STARFlex device.<br/>
- Medical therapy treated with warfarin or aspirin or both at investigator's discretion.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary outcome (composite of stroke/TIA, death from any cause within 30 days, or death from neurologic causes within 31 days to 2 years): 5.5% in closure group vs 6.8% in medical therapy, adjusted HR 0.78 (95% CI, 0.45 to 1.35; P=0.37).<br/>
- Stroke: 2.9% closure group vs 3.1% medical therapy (P=0.79).<br/>
- TIA: 3.1% closure group vs 4.1% medical therapy (P=0.44).<br/>
- No significant differences in rates of other serious adverse events.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Did not have power to detect small reductions in event rates.<br/>
- The results do not preclude a role for PFO closure in highly selected patient groups.<br/>
- Increased rate of atrial fibrillation in the closure group.<br/>
- Periprocedural major vascular complications occurred only in the closure group (3.2%).<br/>
