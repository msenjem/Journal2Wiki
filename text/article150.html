 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA who also have a patent foramen ovale, closure with a device did not result in a greater benefit than medical therapy alone in preventing recurrent stroke or TIA.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The association between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke has prompted consideration of percutaneous closure devices as a preventive strategy. The CLOSURE I trial compared percutaneous PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy to medical therapy alone in preventing recurrent neurologic events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time of the study, closure of PFO with a percutaneous transcatheter device was an investigational procedure by the FDA. Many patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO were treated off-label.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-group superiority trial.
- Participants: 909 patients, aged 18-60, with cryptogenic stroke or TIA and PFO.
- Interventions: Closure with STARFlex device plus antiplatelet therapy (n=447) vs medical therapy alone (n=462).
- 2 years of follow-up.
- Primary outcome: Composite of stroke or TIA, any death within 30 days, or death from neurologic causes between 31 days and 2 years.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion criteria: Patients 18-60 years, had ischemic stroke or TIA within 6 months, evidence of PFO.
- Exclusion criteria: Identified potential causes of ischemic stroke or TIA other than PFO.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Percutaneous closure of PFO with STARFlex device.
- Medical therapy treated with warfarin or aspirin or both at investigator's discretion.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcome (composite of stroke/TIA, death from any cause within 30 days, or death from neurologic causes within 31 days to 2 years): 5.5% in closure group vs 6.8% in medical therapy, adjusted HR 0.78 (95% CI, 0.45 to 1.35; P=0.37).
- Stroke: 2.9% closure group vs 3.1% medical therapy (P=0.79).
- TIA: 3.1% closure group vs 4.1% medical therapy (P=0.44).
- No significant differences in rates of other serious adverse events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Did not have power to detect small reductions in event rates.
- The results do not preclude a role for PFO closure in highly selected patient groups.
- Increased rate of atrial fibrillation in the closure group.
- Periprocedural major vascular complications occurred only in the closure group (3.2%).
