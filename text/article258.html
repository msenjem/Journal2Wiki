    "Dexamethasone in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19". The New England Journal of Medicine. <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question:</strong></h2><br/>
Does the addition of dexamethasone to usual care improve 28-day mortality in patients hospitalized with Covid-19?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></h2><br/>
In hospitalized patients with Covid-19, dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone but not among patients without respiratory support.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points:</strong></h2><br/>
Severe Covid-19 can lead to respiratory failure and death, potentially related to the host's immune response. The RECOVERY trial evaluated the mortality benefit of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, in hospitalized Covid-19 patients requiring respiratory support. The findings demonstrate that dexamethasone reduces 28-day mortality in patients under invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy but is not beneficial for patients not receiving respiratory support and could potentially be harmful.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines:</strong></h2><br/>
Updated guidelines recommend the use of glucocorticoids in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 requiring oxygen with or without ventilatory support.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design:</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, controlled, open-label trial<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population:</strong></h2><br/>
6,425 patients hospitalized with Covid-19; 2,104 in the dexamethasone group and 4,321 in the usual care group.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions:</strong></h2><br/>
Patients were randomly assigned to receive usual care plus 6 mg of dexamethasone once daily for up to 10 days or usual care alone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes:</strong></h2><br/>
The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital discharge within 28 days and progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomization.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms:</strong></h2><br/>
- Open-label design without placebo control<br/>
- Dexamethasone not beneficial for patients without respiratory support<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding:</strong></h2><br/>
Funded by the Medical Research Council, National Institute for Health Research, and others.<br/>
