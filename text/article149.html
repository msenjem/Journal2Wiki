 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Preventive PCI in noninfarct arteries with significant stenosis during primary PCI for STEMI significantly reduces the risk of future adverse cardiovascular events compared to treating the infarct artery alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The PRAMI study found that in patients with STEMI undergoing PCI for the infarct-related artery, additional preventive PCI in noninfarct coronary arteries with major stenoses significantly reduced rates of death from cardiac causes, nonfatal MI, and refractory angina, compared with no additional PCI.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend PCI of the infarct artery only in STEMI patients with multivessel disease, owing to previous lack of evidence regarding the value of preventive PCI.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">PRAMI was a multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted from April 2008 through January 2013. The trial was prematurely stopped based on recommendations due to a significant reduction in primary outcome events favoring preventive PCI.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial enrolled 465 patients with acute STEMI and multivessel coronary disease detected at the time of emergency PCI for the infarct artery. 
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Acute STEMI, including three patients with left bundle-branch block
- Successful PCI treatment of the infarct artery
- Stenosis of â‰¥50% in other coronary arteries treatable by PCI
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Cardiogenic shock
- Previous coronary-artery bypass grafting
- Ineligibility due to other specified concerns
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to receive either no further PCI procedures after the infarct-artery PCI (n=231) or to undergo immediate preventive PCI in noninfarct arteries with >50% stenoses (n=234).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiac causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or refractory angina.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary outcomes occurred in 21 patients in the preventive-PCI group and 53 in the infarct-artery-only PCI group, revealing a significant hazard ratio of 0.35 in favor of preventive PCI. Hazard ratios for death from cardiac causes, nonfatal MI, and refractory angina were also in favor of preventive PCI. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study did not address whether the benefits of preventive PCI extend to patients with non-STEMI or whether immediate or delayed (staged) preventive PCI is superior.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by Barts and the London Charity.
