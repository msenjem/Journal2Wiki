    "Endovascular Therapy for Ischemic Stroke with Perfusion-Imaging Selection".<br/>
The New England Journal of Medicine. 2013. 368:914-923.<br/>
PubMed•Full text•PDF<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does endovascular therapy improve outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke when selected based on perfusion-imaging and stratified by penumbral pattern?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Penumbral imaging with CT or MRI did not identify patients who would benefit from endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke, and endovascular treatment with first-generation devices showed no superiority to standard care.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Mechanical thrombectomy has been proposed to be beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, especially when administered within a narrow time window. However, whether advanced imaging could identify a subset of patients that benefit most from endovascular therapy remained uncertain.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of publication, no updated guidelines have been reflected based on this study's findings. Moreover, newer-generation stent retrievers, not included in the study, may have different levels of clinical efficacy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, phase 2b, randomized, controlled, open-label, blinded outcome trial<br/>
- N=118 patients with large-vessel, anterior-circulation ischemic strokes<br/>
- Randomized to mechanical embolectomy (n=64) or standard care (n=54)<br/>
- Mean patient age: 65.5 years<br/>
- Mean time to enrollment: 5.5 hours<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
- Age between 18 and 85 years<br/>
- NIHSS scores of 6 to 29<br/>
- Large-vessel, anterior-circulation ischemic stroke<br/>
- Randomized within 8 hours after symptom onset<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
- Any contraindication to endovascular therapy<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
- Mean age: 65.5 years<br/>
- 58% had a favorable penumbral pattern<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Mechanical embolectomy (Merci Retriever or Penumbra System) or standard medical care<br/>
- All patients underwent pretreatment CT or MRI brain imaging<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcomes<br/>
- No significant interaction between pretreatment imaging pattern and treatment assignment based on 90-day modified Rankin scale scores<br/>
- Among all patients, no difference in mean scores on the modified Rankin scale between embolectomy and standard care<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Embolectomy was not superior to standard care even in patients with a favorable penumbral pattern<br/>
- 90-day mortality was 21%; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was 4%<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Limited by the use of first-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices, advances in clinical practices over the 8-year study period, and variable timing in treatment and imaging approaches.<br/>
- Study results may not apply to newer-generation thrombectomy devices with reportedly higher rates of revascularization and better clinical outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
