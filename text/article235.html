    "Edoxaban versus Dalteparin for Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism". The New England Journal of Medicine. 2017.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Is oral edoxaban noninferior to subcutaneous dalteparin in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding in patients with cancer?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Edoxaban is noninferior to dalteparin with respect to the composite outcome of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding in patients with cancer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Venous thromboembolism is a frequent complication in patients with cancer which complicates their treatment and care. Low-molecular-weight heparin is the standard treatment; however, direct oral anticoagulants offer a potential for ease of use but their efficacy and safety in this scenario were unclear.<br/>
In the Hokusai VTE Cancer trial, edoxaban compared to dalteparin was noninferior for the composite outcome of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding, though showing a higher rate of major bleeding particularly in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Open-label, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
1,046 adult patients with active cancer and acute symptomatic or incidentally detected venous thromboembolism.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral edoxaban (60 mg once daily) or subcutaneous dalteparin (200 IU/kg once daily for one month, followed by 150 IU/kg once daily).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
The primary outcome was a composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding within a 12-month period after randomization. Recurrent venous thromboembolism was lower in the edoxaban group (7.9% vs. 11.3%), but the rates of major bleeding were higher (6.9% vs. 4.0%) compared to the dalteparin group.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Open-label design might introduce bias in reporting of outcomes.<br/>
- The number of primary-outcome events was lower than expected, possibly affecting the power of the trial.<br/>
- Median duration of the assigned treatment was shorter with dalteparin potentially influencing relative efficacy.<br/>
- The trial had a broad spectrum of cancer patients with a wide array of therapies, thus limiting definitive conclusions about individual tumor types.<br/>
