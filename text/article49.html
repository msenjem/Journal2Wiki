<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Does mild systemic hypothermia increase the rate of neurologic recovery after resuscitation from cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Mild systemic hypothermia (32°C to 34°C) for 24 hours improves neurologic outcomes and reduces mortality at six months among patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
The study demonstrated the effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia in patients who had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, showing that it increased the chance of good neurologic recovery (defined as a cerebral-performance category of 1 or 2) and decreased mortality at six months. This study contributed to the establishment of therapeutic hypothermia as a standard of care in post-cardiac arrest management for appropriate patients.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
As of the knowledge cutoff date, therapeutic hypothermia was recommended in guidelines such as those by the AHA/ERC for comatose patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation. <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with blinded assessment of the outcome.<br/>
- N=275 patients with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.<br/>
- Hypothermia group (n=137) vs. Normothermia group (n=138).<br/>
- Enrollment from March 1996 to January 2001.<br/>
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
<br/>
- Witnessed cardiac arrest<br/>
- Initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia<br/>
- Presumed cardiac origin of arrest<br/>
- Age between 18 and 75 years<br/>
- Resuscitation attempts started 5 to 15 minutes from collapse by emergency medical personnel<br/>
- Restoration of spontaneous circulation within 60 minutes from collapse<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
<br/>
- Tympanic-membrane temperature below 30°C on admission<br/>
- Comatose state due to central nervous system depressants<br/>
- Pregnancy<br/>
- Response to verbal commands post-resuscitation<br/>
- Severe hypotension or hypoxemia post-resuscitation<br/>
- Terminal illness pre-arrest<br/>
- Cardiac arrest after arrival of medical personnel<br/>
- Known coagulopathies<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
<br/>
Groups were generally similar, although patients in the normothermia group were more likely to have histories of diabetes and coronary heart disease and to have received bystander CPR.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
- Hypothermia group was cooled to a targeted body temperature of 32°C to 34°C for 24 hours using an external cooling device, followed by passive rewarming.<br/>
- Normothermia group received standard care with maintenance of normal body temperature.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
<br/>
- Favorable neurologic outcome at six months, defined as cerebral-performance category of 1 or 2.<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
<br/>
- Mortality at six months.<br/>
- Rate of complications within seven days post-cardiac arrest.<br/>
<br/>
Mortality and neurologic outcome were significantly improved in the hypothermia group. The rate of complications such as bleeding, pneumonia, sepsis, and arrhythmias did not significantly differ between groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Supported by grants from the European Union, the Austrian Ministry of Science and Transport, and the Austrian Science Foundation. The cooling device was provided by Kinetic Concepts.<br/>
