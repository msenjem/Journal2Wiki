 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Low-dose vasopressin did not reduce mortality rates as compared with norepinephrine among patients with septic shock who were treated with catecholamine vasopressors.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST) evaluated the effect of low-dose vasopressin versus norepinephrine in patients with septic shock already treated with conventional vasopressors. The study aimed to determine if vasopressin, utilized for its potential to restore vascular tone and blood pressure in septic shock, could decrease mortality when compared to norepinephrine. The trial concluded that there was no significant difference in mortality at 28 days and 90 days between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Modern guidelines from the ACC/AHA do not comment on the use of antiarrhythmic medications in ACS care.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial.
- N=778 patients with septic shock on a minimum of 5 μg of norepinephrine per minute.
- Intervention: Low-dose vasopressin (0.01 to 0.03 U per minute) (n=396) vs norepinephrine (5 to 15 μg per minute) (n=382).
- All vasopressor infusions were titrated and tapered to maintain a target blood pressure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients age 16 and older with septic shock and low-dose norepinephrine.
- Excluded if septic shock was unresponsive to fluids or if specific exclusion criteria were met. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients received either low-dose vasopressin or norepinephrine infusion in addition to open-label vasopressors, titrated to maintain target blood pressure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: 28-day mortality rate.
- Secondary: 90-day mortality, days free of organ dysfunction, vasopressor use, ventilation, SIRS, corticosteroid use, and length of ICU and hospital stay.
- Serious adverse events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Infusion range of vasopressin was fixed, and no adjustments were made based on vasopressin levels.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
