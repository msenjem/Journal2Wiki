<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In critically ill patients, does a restrictive strategy of red-cell transfusion (maintaining hemoglobin 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter) compared with a liberal strategy (maintaining hemoglobin 10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter) affect 30-day mortality?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
A restrictive transfusion strategy maintaining hemoglobin levels between 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter in critically ill patients was at least as effective as and possibly superior to a liberal transfusion strategy, potentially reducing the average number of red-cell units transfused and 30-day mortality. <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Previous strategies involving liberal red-cell transfusions in critically ill patients to augment oxygen delivery were challenged by concerns over potential transfusion-related complications and the scarcity of blood. The study compared the effects of maintaining lower (7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter) versus higher (10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter) hemoglobin levels in critically ill patients and found that a restrictive approach to red-cell transfusion may be superior in reducing mortality rates and associated complications.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines may reflect on the results of this study by recommending a more conservative approach to transfusions in critically ill patients, with specific considerations for individual clinical circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial<br/>
- N=838 critically ill patients with euvolemia and hemoglobin &lt;9.0 g per deciliter within 72 hours after ICU admission<br/>
- Restrictive strategy (n=418): Transfusion if hemoglobin &lt;7.0 g per deciliter (target 7.0-9.0 g per deciliter)<br/>
- Liberal strategy (n=420): Transfusion if hemoglobin &lt;10.0 g per deciliter (target 10.0-12.0 g per deciliter)<br/>
- Setting: 25 hospitals in Canada<br/>
- Enrollment: November 1994 to November 1997<br/>
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat<br/>
- Primary outcome: Mortality from any cause at 30 days<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria: Critically ill patients expected to stay in ICU &gt;24 hours, with hemoglobin concentration ≤9.0 g per deciliter within 72 hours of ICU admission, considered euvolemic after initial treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria: Age &lt;16 years, refusal of blood products, active blood loss at enrollment, chronic anemia, pregnancy, brain death, treatment withholding or withdrawal decisions, post-routine cardiac surgery.<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics: Similar between groups, average age 57.6 years, average APACHE II score 21, majority on mechanical ventilation, and common admission reasons were respiratory and cardiac diseases.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Patients managed according to the transfusion strategy to which they were assigned during their ICU stay.<br/>
- Suggestions for use of fluids and vasoactive drugs provided.<br/>
- Other management decisions left to discretion of physicians.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcomes: 30-day mortality was 18.7% in the restrictive-strategy group compared to 23.3% in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.11).<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes: <br/>
- Hospitalization mortality was lower in the restrictive-strategy group (22.2% vs. 28.1%, P=0.05).<br/>
- Rates of multiorgan failure did not significantly differ between groups.<br/>
- 60-day mortality, ICU mortality, and survival time in the first 30 days showed no significant differences.<br/>
- Rates of cardiac complications favored the restrictive strategy (P&lt;0.01).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Potential impact of noncompliance with transfusion protocols and physician crossover between treatment groups on the results.<br/>
- While representing a variety of critical illnesses, the trial excluded certain patient populations, thus limiting the generalizability of findings to all critically ill patients.<br/>
