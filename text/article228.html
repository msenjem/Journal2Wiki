<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
In patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis, does the addition of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis to anticoagulation reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Among patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis, the addition of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis to anticoagulation did not reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome but increased the risk of major bleeding.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
The post-thrombotic syndrome, a frequent complication of proximal deep-vein thrombosis, can cause long-term pain, swelling, and ulcers in the affected limb. Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), involving the intrathrombus delivery of thrombolytic drugs and mechanical thrombus removal, was hypothesized to reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
As of the current knowledge cutoff date, there are no updated guidelines reflecting the results of this trial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Multicenter, randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded, controlled clinical trial.<br/>
N=692 patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis randomized into two groups:<br/>
   - Pharmacomechanical CDT plus anticoagulation (n=337)<br/>
   - Anticoagulation alone (control group) (n=355)<br/>
Setting: 56 clinical centers in the United States<br/>
Enrollment: 2009-2014<br/>
Mean follow-up: 24 months<br/>
Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat<br/>
Primary outcome: Development of the post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
<br/>
- Symptomatic proximal deep-vein thrombosis involving the femoral, common femoral, or iliac vein.<br/>
- Age 16 to 75 years not pregnant, within 14 days of symptom onset, and without high bleeding risk or established post-thrombotic syndrome.<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
<br/>
- Patients younger than 16 or older than 75 years, pregnant individuals, high bleeding risk, active cancer, established post-thrombotic syndrome, or ipsilateral deep-vein thrombosis in the previous 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
<br/>
- Well-matched between treatment groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
- Anticoagulant therapy consistent with published guidelines.<br/>
- Pharmacomechanical CDT involved intrathrombus administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), thrombus aspiration/maceration (with or without stenting).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
<br/>
- No significant difference in the post-thrombotic syndrome development between CDT (47%) and control (48%) groups (RR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.11; P=0.56).<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
<br/>
- More early major bleeds within 10 days in CDT group (1.7% vs. 0.3%, P=0.049).<br/>
- No significant difference in recurrent venous thromboembolism over 24 months between groups (12% CDT vs. 8% control, P=0.09).<br/>
- Moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome less in CDT group (18% vs. 24%, RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P=0.04).<br/>
- Less severe post-thrombotic syndrome scores in CDT group across all follow-up points (P&lt;0.01).<br/>
- No significant difference in quality of life improvement between groups from baseline to 24 months.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
- Missing data may have led to an underestimate of treatment effects.<br/>
- Limited power for subgroup analysis.<br/>
<br/>
