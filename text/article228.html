 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Among patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis, the addition of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis to anticoagulation did not reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome but increased the risk of major bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">The post-thrombotic syndrome, a frequent complication of proximal deep-vein thrombosis, can cause long-term pain, swelling, and ulcers in the affected limb. Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), involving the intrathrombus delivery of thrombolytic drugs and mechanical thrombus removal, was hypothesized to reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">The ATTRACT trial, a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded controlled clinical trial, compared the use of CDT plus anticoagulation against anticoagulation alone in patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis. The addition of CDT did not result in a reduction in the risk of developing post-thrombotic syndrome but was associated with a higher risk for major bleeding events.

N=692 patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis randomized into two groups:
   - Pharmacomechanical CDT plus anticoagulation (n=337)
   - Anticoagulation alone (control group) (n=355)
Setting: 56 clinical centers in the United States
Enrollment: 2009-2014
Mean follow-up: 24 months
Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat
Primary outcome: Development of the post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months

 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Symptomatic proximal deep-vein thrombosis involving the femoral, common femoral, or iliac vein.

 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Patients younger than 16 or older than 75 years, pregnant individuals, high bleeding risk, active cancer, established post-thrombotic syndrome, or ipsilateral deep-vein thrombosis in the previous 2 years.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics

 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Anticoagulant therapy consistent with published guidelines.

 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- More early major bleeds within 10 days in CDT group (1.7% vs. 0.3%, P=0.049).
- No significant difference in recurrent venous thromboembolism over 24 months between groups (12% CDT vs. 8% control, P=0.09).
- Moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome less in CDT group (18% vs. 24%, RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P=0.04).
- Less severe post-thrombotic syndrome scores in CDT group across all follow-up points (P<0.01).
