 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does nintedanib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Nintedanib reduced the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive lung disease with limited treatment options, characterized by a decline in lung function and quality of life. The INPULSIS trials were two replicate phase 3 studies that demonstrated that nintedanib significantly reduced the rate of decline in FVC over a 52-week treatment period in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting a slowing of disease progression.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the latest updates, these trials have contributed to nintedanib being included in clinical guidelines as a treatment option for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Two replicate 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials (INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2).
- N=1066 patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive nintedanib or placebo.
- Intervention: 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Participants were 40 years or older with a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis within the last 5 years.
- Patients required an FVC of ≥50% and a diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 30-79%.
- High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed within 12 months prior to trial.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age ≥40 years
- Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis within previous 5 years
- FVC ≥50% of predicted value
- DLCO 30-79% of the predicted value
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Prednisone >15 mg/day (or equivalent)
- Investigational treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
- Recent surgical lung biopsy incompatible with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Similar across intervention and placebo groups in each trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Nintedanib 150 mg twice daily or placebo for 52 weeks.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC 
  INPULSIS-1: −114.7 ml (nintedanib) vs. −239.9 ml (placebo); difference: 125.3 ml, P<0.001
  INPULSIS-2: −113.6 ml (nintedanib) vs. −207.3 ml (placebo); difference: 93.7 ml, P<0.001
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Secondary Outcome
- Time to first acute exacerbation
  INPULSIS-1: No significant difference (HR 1.15; P=0.67)
  INPULSIS-2: Significant benefit (HR 0.38; P=0.005)
- Change from baseline in SGRQ score
  INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2: Inconsistent significant differences
- Diarrhea was the most common adverse event associated with nintedanib.
