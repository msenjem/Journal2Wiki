 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In high-risk hypertensive patients, combination therapy with benazepril (an ACE inhibitor) and amlodipine (a calcium-channel blocker) was more effective at reducing cardiovascular events than a combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and treatment often requires a combination of antihypertensive agents to achieve recommended blood pressure targets. While current guidelines include thiazide diuretics in combination regimens, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial aimed to determine the effectiveness of an alternative combination therapy of benazepril plus amlodipine compared to benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend use of a thiazide diuretic in combination antihypertensive regimens, but the ACCOMPLISH trial suggests an alternative combination therapy that might be superior for certain populations.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
N=11,506 patients with high-risk hypertension.
Benazepril-amlodipine group (n=5,744)
Benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (n=5,762)
Mean follow-up: 36 months.
Primary outcome: composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, and coronary revascularization.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Patients with hypertension at high risk for cardiovascular events.
Exclusion Criteria: Not specified.
Baseline Characteristics: Mean age 68.4 years; 39.5% women; diabetic patients accounted for 60.4% of the population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Benazepril-amlodipine: Patients started on a combination of 20 mg benazepril and 5 mg amlodipine once daily.
Benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide: Patients started on a combination of 20 mg benazepril and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily.
Doses adjusted to manage blood pressure, with additional antihypertensive agents allowed.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: After 36 months, the benazepril-amlodipine group had a lower rate of the primary composite outcome than the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (9.6% vs. 11.8%, P<0.001).
Secondary Outcome: For the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, the benazepril-amlodipine group had fewer events compared to the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (5.0% vs. 6.3%, P=0.002).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The study population comprised patients with previous coronary disease and diabetes, which may not fully represent the broader hypertensive population.
- The dosing of hydrochlorothiazide may not reflect the optimal dose for cardiovascular benefit.
