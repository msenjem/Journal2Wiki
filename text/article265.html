 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does early initiation of antiretroviral therapy improve survival in asymptomatic patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection compared to deferred therapy?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy before the CD4+ count fell below two prespecified thresholds (351 to 500 cells per cubic millimeter or >500 cells per cubic millimeter) significantly improved survival compared with deferred therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A large observational study involving 17,517 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients assessed the timing of initiation of antiretroviral therapy and its impact on survival. Patients were grouped by CD4+ counts at therapy initiation (either 351-500 cells per cubic millimeter or >500 cells per cubic millimeter), and compared with patients who deferred treatment until CD4+ counts fell below these thresholds. In patients with CD4+ counts of 351-500, deferred therapy increased the risk of death by 69% compared with early initiation. For patients with CD4+ counts >500, deferral increased mortality risk by 94%.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend initiation of antiretroviral therapy in asymptomatic patients with CD4+ counts less than 350 cells per cubic millimeter, acknowledging the lack of randomized clinical trial data regarding this recommendation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Two parallel analyses of a multicenter, observational cohort study involving patients from the United States and Canada.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Asymptomatic HIV-infected patients
- CD4+ count of 351-500 cells per cubic millimeter or >500 cells per cubic millimeter
- No previous antiretroviral therapy
- No history of AIDS-defining illness
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Not reported
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Patients initiating early therapy were slightly older and more likely to be white men.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients were classified into two treatment strategies: early initiation of antiretroviral therapy or deferral until CD4+ count decreased below threshold levels.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Risk of death
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Not reported
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Observational study design does not eliminate possibility of confounding.
- The decision to initiate or defer therapy could have been influenced by factors not measured in this study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">National Institutes of Health and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
