 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Enalapril, in addition to conventional therapy for heart failure, significantly reduced both mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and low ejection fractions.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Congestive heart failure (CHF) carries a high mortality rate and frequent hospitalizations. Previous studies suggested benefits from vasodilator therapy. This study aimed to assess the effect of the ACE inhibitor enalapril on mortality in patients with CHF and ejection fractions ≤0.35.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">No specific guidelines were mentioned in this study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with CHF (n=2569; placebo=1284, enalapril=1285) with ejection fractions ≤0.35.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- CHF on conventional therapy, not including ACE inhibitors.
- Ejection fractions ≤0.35 by various measures (radionuclide, contrast angiography, or echocardiography).
- Enrolled between June 1986 and March 1989.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Over 80 years, hemodynamically significant valvular disease, unstable angina, recent MI (<1 month), severe pulmonary disease, creatinine >2 mg/dL, and other conditions limiting survival or trial participation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Placebo or enalapril 2.5 to 20 mg per day, with titration based on tolerability.
- Initial two-week dosing, followed by 14-17 days of placebo for stabilization.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes:
- Total mortality: 510 deaths (39.7%) in placebo vs. 452 (35.2%) in enalapril group (risk reduction 16%; P=0.0036).
- Death attributed to progressive heart failure was reduced by 22% (P=0.0045).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Fewer patients in the enalapril group (n=613) died or were hospitalized for worsening CHF compared to placebo (n=736); risk reduction 26% (P<0.0001).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The effect of enalapril was less clear in patients with ejection fractions >0.30 and those in NYHA class IV.
- Open-label ACE inhibitors were allowed during the trial, potentially confounding results.
- Higher incidence of non-fatal gastrointestinal system neoplasms in the enalapril group, although this may have been due to detection bias.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and a gift from Merck Sharp and Dohme, which did not participate in the study design, conduct, monitoring, or analysis.
