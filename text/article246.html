    "CAR T-Cell Therapy bb2121 in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma".The New England Journal of Medicine. 2019. <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy bb2121, which targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), improve outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, bb2121 CAR T-cell therapy resulted in an 85% objective response rate, with a median progression-free survival of 11.8 months. Toxicity was manageable, with mostly low-grade cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxic effects.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Multiple myeloma remains a disease with no curative treatment, and patients often experience relapse even after multiple lines of therapy. The CAR T-cell therapy bb2121 represents an innovative approach by redirecting the patient's own T cells to target BCMA, which is expressed on myeloma cells. This phase 1 study demonstrated substantial efficacy in a heavily pretreated population, with high response rates and durable remissions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of the knowledge cutoff date, no guidelines have been established for bb2121 in the context of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma due to the novelty of the treatment.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Open-label, phase 1, multicenter study with two parts: a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase.<br/>
N=33 patients who received bb2121.<br/>
Setting: Multiple centers in the United States.<br/>
Enrollment: 2016-2018.<br/>
Mean follow-up: 11.3 months.<br/>
Analysis: Intention-to-treat.<br/>
Primary outcome: Safety profile of bb2121 therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Age â‰¥18 years.<br/>
- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 0 or 1.<br/>
- Measurable disease with specific laboratory criteria.<br/>
- At least three previous lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, or refractory to both drug classes.<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria based on their medical condition and prior treatments.<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
- Median age: 60 years (range, 37 to 75).<br/>
- Median time since diagnosis: 5 years (range, 1 to 36).<br/>
- Patients had received a median of 7 to 8 prior treatment regimens.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Single infusion of bb2121 with varying doses (50x10^6 to 800x10^6 CAR-positive [CAR+] T cells).<br/>
- Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcomes<br/>
- Safety: Hematologic toxic effects most common, including neutropenia (85%), leukopenia (58%), anemia (45%), and thrombocytopenia (45%).<br/>
- Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 25 patients (76%), mostly grade 1 or 2.<br/>
- Neurologic toxic effects occurred in 42% of patients, with one reversible grade 4 event.<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Objective response rate: 85%.<br/>
- Complete response rate: 45%.<br/>
- Median progression-free survival: 11.8 months.<br/>
- Persistence of CAR T cells was observed in 20% of patients at 12 months.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Small sample size in this phase 1 study limits the generalizability of the results.<br/>
- Longer follow-up is required to determine long-term durability of responses and potential late toxic effects.<br/>
