 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does ibrutinib improve clinical outcomes in symptomatic patients with previously treated Waldenström's macroglobulinemia?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In previously treated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, ibrutinib was effective in achieving a high overall response rate of 90.5% and promoting durable responses with a 2-year progression-free-survival rate of 69.1%.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is a malignant B-cell lymphoma with limited treatment options upon progression. Ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has proven to be a promising therapy due to the high prevalence of MYD88L265P mutation that activates tumor-cell growth via Bruton's tyrosine kinase pathway. CXCR4WHIM mutations confer in vitro resistance to ibrutinib, thus creating a need to understand the impact of these mutations on treatment outcomes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of 2015, no guidelines have been published that reflect the results of this trial for the use of ibrutinib in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prospective, multicenter study of 63 symptomatic patients with previously treated Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
Symptomatic patients requiring treatment, one or more prior regiments, adequate counts, no central nervous system involvement, no significant cardiovascular disease.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
Central nervous system lymphoma, significant cardiovascular disease, use of warfarin, or medications prolonging the QT interval.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
Patients had received a median of two prior therapies. Baseline MYD88L265P mutation present in 89%, CXCR4WHIM in 34%. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">420 mg of ibrutinib orally per day for up to twenty-six 4-week cycles, with further treatment continuation upon re-consent.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Overall response rate was 90.5%, with a major response rate of 73.0%. Median serum IgM levels decreased and hemoglobin levels increased significantly.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Estimated 2-year progression-free survival was 69.1%, with an overall survival rate of 95.2%. Responses were highest among patients with MYD88L265P and wild-type CXCR4 genotype.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was supported by Pharmacyclics, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, various foundations, and private donations.
