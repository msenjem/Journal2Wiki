    "As-needed Budesonide–Formoterol in Mild Asthma". The New England Journal of Medicine. 2019.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In adults with mild asthma, is as-needed budesonide–formoterol more effective than as-needed albuterol and budesonide maintenance therapy plus as-needed albuterol in preventing asthma exacerbations?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In adults with mild asthma, as-needed budesonide–formoterol reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations compared with as-needed albuterol and was superior to both as-needed albuterol and budesonide maintenance therapy plus as-needed albuterol in reducing the risk of severe exacerbations.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
This 52-week, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, controlled trial assessed the efficacy of as-needed budesonide–formoterol in mild asthma. Among patients previously taking only a short-acting β2-agonist (SABA), those using as-needed budesonide–formoterol had lower rates of asthma exacerbations than those using albuterol alone. The risk of severe exacerbation was also lower with as-needed budesonide–formoterol compared to both albuterol alone and budesonide maintenance therapy with as-needed albuterol. These results suggest that budesonide–formoterol as-needed therapy has a role in asthma management without the need for regular maintenance therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
No information provided regarding guidelines.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, controlled trial<br/>
- N=668 adults with mild asthma<br/>
- Interventions:<br/>
  1. Albuterol as needed (n=224)<br/>
  2. Budesonide maintenance plus as-needed albuterol (n=222)<br/>
  3. As-needed budesonide–formoterol (n=222)<br/>
- Duration: 52 weeks<br/>
- Primary outcome: Annualized rate of asthma exacerbations<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Adults aged 18-75 with a doctor’s diagnosis of asthma, using only a SABA in the previous three months.<br/>
- Age: Mean 44.8 years<br/>
- Female: 66%<br/>
- Smoking history: 10.8%<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio.<br/>
- Albuterol group received 100 μg as needed for symptoms.<br/>
- Budesonide maintenance group received budesonide 200 μg inhalation twice daily plus as-needed albuterol.<br/>
- Budesonide–formoterol group received 200 μg budesonide and 6 μg formoterol as needed for symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcomes: The annualized exacerbation rate was lower in the budesonide–formoterol group compared to the albuterol group (0.195 vs. 0.400 per patient-year). There was no significant difference between the budesonide–formoterol and budesonide maintenance groups.<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes: The number of severe exacerbations was lower in the budesonide–formoterol group than in the other two groups.<br/>
- Other Observations: Budesonide maintenance treatment provided better control of asthma symptoms.<br/>
- Inhaler adherence: Overall adherence to budesonide maintenance was 56%.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- More frequent clinic visits than expected in routine clinical practice.<br/>
- Open-label design may introduce bias.<br/>
- Exacerbation rate was lower than anticipated, but the relative rate difference was greater than predicted.<br/>
<br/>

- AstraZeneca and the Health Research Council of New Zealand.<br/>
