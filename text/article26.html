 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Is transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) superior to surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at low surgical risk?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among patients with severe aortic stenosis at low risk for surgical complications, TAVR significantly reduced rates of death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year compared to surgery.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Previous studies established TAVR as a beneficial alternative to surgery in higher-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. This trial assessed TAVR versus surgery in lower-risk patients, finding lower rates of key outcomes like death, strokes, and rehospitalization for TAVR, favoring its use in a wider patient population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last update, guidelines did not include the results of this trial for recommending treatments in low-risk patients. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, nonblinded trial
- N=1,000 patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk
- Intervention: Transfemoral TAVR (n=503)
- Comparator: Surgical aortic-valve replacement (n=497)
- Primary outcome: Composite of death from any cause, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year
- Follow-Up: 1 year
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis and low surgical risk
- STS-PROM (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality) score <4%
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Clinical frailty, bicuspid aortic valves, or anatomy increasing the risk for both TAVR and surgery complications
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age: 73 years
- Male: 69.3%
- STS-PROM: 1.9%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Transfemoral placement of a balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve (TAVR group)
- Surgical aortic-valve replacement with commercially available bioprosthetic valve (surgery group)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- TAVR: 8.5% had composite events at 1 year
- Surgery: 15.1% had composite events at 1 year
- Absolute difference: -6.6 percentage points (P<0.001 for noninferiority and superiority)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Lower rates of stroke at 30 days (P=0.02)
- Shorter duration of the index_gpt hospitalization (P<0.001)
- Lower rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation (P<0.001)
- More rapid improvements in functional status and quality of life measures with TAVR
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial was funded by Edwards Lifesciences.
