    "Icosapent Ethyl for Elevated Triglyceride Levels". The New England Journal of Medicine. Published on November 10, 2018. PMID: 30415628.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does treatment with icosapent ethyl reduce ischemic events in patients with elevated triglyceride levels who are receiving statin therapy?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with elevated triglyceride levels despite statin therapy, 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily significantly lowered the risk of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, compared to placebo.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of the knowledge cutoff date for this assistant, potential updates to guidelines reflecting the results of this trial are yet to be published.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 8,179 patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes and additional risk factors, elevated fasting triglyceride levels (135 to 499 mg per deciliter), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 41 to 100 mg per deciliter. Participants were randomized to receive either 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily or placebo and were followed for a median of 4.9 years.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
The trial included adults aged 45 or older with established cardiovascular disease or 50 or older with diabetes plus additional risk factors. The median age was 64, and 28.8% were female.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients received either 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily, totaling a daily dose of 4 g, or placebo.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina.<br/>
- The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The use of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors was not common during the trial period.<br/>
- The mineral oil placebo used could potentially have affected statin absorption, which may have influenced the trial outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The trial was funded by Amarin Pharma.<br/>
