 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with elevated triglyceride levels despite statin therapy, 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily significantly lowered the risk of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, compared to placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Previous trials with niacin, fibrates, and certain nâˆ’3 fatty acids showed no reduction in cardiovascular events despite lowering triglyceride levels. However, the REDUCE-IT trial, using a high dose of a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (icosapent ethyl), indicated a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes in a high-risk population already on statin therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date for this assistant, potential updates to guidelines reflecting the results of this trial are yet to be published.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 8,179 patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes and additional risk factors, elevated fasting triglyceride levels (135 to 499 mg per deciliter), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 41 to 100 mg per deciliter. Participants were randomized to receive either 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily or placebo and were followed for a median of 4.9 years.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial included adults aged 45 or older with established cardiovascular disease or 50 or older with diabetes plus additional risk factors. The median age was 64, and 28.8% were female.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients received either 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily, totaling a daily dose of 4 g, or placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina.
- The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The use of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors was not common during the trial period.
- The mineral oil placebo used could potentially have affected statin absorption, which may have influenced the trial outcomes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Amarin Pharma.
