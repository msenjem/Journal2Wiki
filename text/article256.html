    "Aspirin for the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism". The New England Journal of Medicine. Published on November 4, 2012.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does aspirin reduce the recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients who have completed initial anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of unprovoked VTE?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE have a high risk of recurrence when anticoagulants are discontinued. Although aspirin is effective in preventing arterial thrombotic events and primary VTE in high-risk surgical patients, its efficacy in preventing recurrent VTE after the discontinuation of anticoagulants was uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
At the time of publication and the conclusion of the study, guidelines reflecting these results were not specified.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria:<br/>
- At least 18 years of age<br/>
- Completed initial anticoagulation therapy (6 weeks to 24 months) after a first unprovoked episode of symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis or acute pulmonary embolism<br/>
Exclusion Criteria:<br/>
- VTE occurred more than 2 years before enrollment<br/>
- Patients with indications or contraindications to aspirin or other antiplatelet therapy, patients who required long-term anticoagulation, or those with other serious conditions<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Aspirin 100 mg daily (n=411)<br/>
- Placebo (n=411)<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome:<br/>
- Recurrence of VTE. The aspirin group showed a 26% risk reduction compared to placebo, but this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.05; P=0.09).<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes:<br/>
- Major vascular events defined as a composite of VTE, MI, stroke, or cardiovascular death were reduced by 34% in the aspirin group compared to placebo (hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.92; P=0.01).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The study did not reach the initial recruitment goal, resulting in limited power to detect a significant reduction in the primary outcome.<br/>
- High rate of discontinuation of the study drug may have underestimated the benefits of aspirin therapy.<br/>
<br/>
