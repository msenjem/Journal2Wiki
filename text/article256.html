 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In the ASPIRE study, aspirin did not significantly reduce the rate of recurrent VTE compared to placebo, but resulted in a significant reduction in major vascular events in patients who have completed anticoagulation therapy for a first unprovoked VTE.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE have a high risk of recurrence when anticoagulants are discontinued. Although aspirin is effective in preventing arterial thrombotic events and primary VTE in high-risk surgical patients, its efficacy in preventing recurrent VTE after the discontinuation of anticoagulants was uncertain.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time of publication and the conclusion of the study, guidelines reflecting these results were not specified.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The ASPIRE trial was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. It involved 822 patients and had a median follow-up period of 37.2 months.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- At least 18 years of age
- Completed initial anticoagulation therapy (6 weeks to 24 months) after a first unprovoked episode of symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis or acute pulmonary embolism
Exclusion Criteria:
- VTE occurred more than 2 years before enrollment
- Patients with indications or contraindications to aspirin or other antiplatelet therapy, patients who required long-term anticoagulation, or those with other serious conditions
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Aspirin 100 mg daily (n=411)
- Placebo (n=411)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome:
- Recurrence of VTE. The aspirin group showed a 26% risk reduction compared to placebo, but this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.05; P=0.09).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Major vascular events defined as a composite of VTE, MI, stroke, or cardiovascular death were reduced by 34% in the aspirin group compared to placebo (hazard ratio with aspirin, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.92; P=0.01).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The study did not reach the initial recruitment goal, resulting in limited power to detect a significant reduction in the primary outcome.
- High rate of discontinuation of the study drug may have underestimated the benefits of aspirin therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia), Health Research Council (New Zealand), Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, National Heart Foundation of Australia, and Bayer HealthCare.
