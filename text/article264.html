<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does daily oral FTC-TDF (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in men and transgender women who have sex with men?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Among men and transgender women who have sex with men, daily oral FTC-TDF use resulted in a 44% reduction in HIV acquisition, and detectable blood levels were strongly correlated with the prophylactic effect.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
The Preexposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPrEx) trial showed that daily oral FTC-TDF use among men and transgender women who have sex with men correlated with a significant reduction in HIV acquisition. The regimen was more effective when blood levels of the drug were detectable, which highlights the importance of adherence.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of 2010, preexposure prophylaxis with FTC-TDF was not yet included in guidelines for HIV prevention, awaiting further evidence and regulatory approvals.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial<br/>
- N=2499 HIV-seronegative men or transgender women who have sex with men<br/>
- FTC-TDF group (n=1248)<br/>
- Placebo group (n=1251)<br/>
- Setting: 11 sites in six countries<br/>
- Enrollment: 2007-2009<br/>
- Follow-up: Median 1.2 years (maximum 2.8 years)<br/>
- Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat<br/>
- Primary outcome: HIV acquisition<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Male sex at birth, age of 18 years or older, HIV-seronegative status, and evidence of high risk for acquisition of HIV infection<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Information not provided<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
- All subjects were born male, although 1% reported their current gender identity as female<br/>
- Mean age ranged from 26.8 to 27.5 years; the FTC-TDF group was on average nine months older than the placebo group<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Administration of daily oral FTC-TDF or placebo<br/>
- Subjects also received HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, condoms, and management of sexually transmitted infections<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome:<br/>
- 36 HIV acquisitions in the FTC-TDF group compared to 64 in the placebo group, representing a 44% reduction in HIV incidence (95% CI, 15 to 63; P=0.005)<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes:<br/>
- Rates of serious adverse events similar in both groups (P=0.57)<br/>
- Nausea reported more frequently during the first 4 weeks in the FTC-TDF group (P&lt;0.001)<br/>
- Similar rates of elevation in serum creatinine in both groups, though more creatinine elevations trended in the FTC-TDF group<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The protective effect of FTC-TDF did not meet the initially hypothesized efficacy rate<br/>
- Drug-level detection was low among users, potentially impacting the study's conclusions about drug efficacy and adherence<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
- Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Study drugs were donated by Gilead Sciences<br/>
