    "Empirical Antibiotic Treatment Strategies for Community-Acquired Pneumonia". The New England Journal of Medicine. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01660204.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with clinically suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to non-ICU wards, is beta-lactam monotherapy noninferior to beta-lactam–macrolide combination therapy, or fluoroquinolone monotherapy, regarding 90-day mortality?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Among patients with clinically suspected CAP admitted to non-ICU wards, a strategy of preferred empirical treatment with beta-lactam monotherapy was noninferior to strategies with beta-lactam–macrolide combination or fluoroquinolone monotherapy in terms of 90-day mortality.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
This trial investigated empirical antibiotic treatments in patients with clinically suspected CAP admitted to non-ICU wards and aimed to determine whether beta-lactam monotherapy was noninferior to other strategies. The study showed that a beta-lactam strategy did not result in higher mortality compared to combination therapy options and may be considered a viable approach to treat such patients.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Most guidelines recommend combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy for empirical treatment of patients with clinically suspected CAP who are admitted to a non-ICU ward. This study suggests reconsidering the addition of macrolides or using fluoroquinolones over beta-lactam monotherapy due to noninferiority in outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, cluster-randomized, crossover trial.<br/>
- Periods of 4 months with rotation of treatment strategies.<br/>
- Hospitals randomized with each strategy.<br/>
- N=2,283 patients with informed consent; median age 70 years.<br/>
- Setting: Seven hospitals in the Netherlands, February 2011 through August 2013.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Adults (age ≥18) with clinically suspected CAP requiring hospitalization in a non-ICU ward.<br/>
- Exclusion: Patients with cystic fibrosis, or not meeting clinical criteria.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Comparative empirical treatment strategies: beta-lactam monotherapy, beta-lactam–macrolide combination, fluoroquinolone monotherapy.<br/>
- Allowed deviations from assigned treatment for medical reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary: 90-day all-cause mortality.<br/>
- Secondary: Time to starting oral treatment, length of hospital stay, minor or major complications during hospital stay.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Findings may not be generalized to regions with different microbial etiologies and resistance profiles. <br/>
- This trial's findings may not apply to patient populations experiencing higher incidence of community-acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, as those would require adaptation of treatment strategies.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
- Funded by the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development.<br/>
- No conflicts of interest were reported.<br/>
<br/>
