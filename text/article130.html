 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with severe heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less being treated with an ACE inhibitor, does the addition of spironolactone reduce mortality and morbidity?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with severe heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, addition of spironolactone to standard therapy including an ACE inhibitor significantly reduces mortality and hospitalization for cardiac reasons, improves symptoms, and is well-tolerated.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Aldosterone has a key role in the progression of heart failure, and standard therapy with an ACE inhibitor may not adequately suppress aldosterone production. Previous research indicated that low doses of spironolactone, an aldosterone-receptor antagonist, in conjunction with standard heart failure treatment, might be effective and safe without leading to serious hyperkalemia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time of this study's publication, guidelines did not reflect the study's findings and would presumably be updated to accommodate the new evidence on spironolactone's effect on heart failure management.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=1,663 patients with recent severe heart failure
- Spironolactone (n=822)
- Placebo (n=841)
- Mean follow-up: 24 months
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- NYHA class IV heart failure within six months before enrollment
- NYHA class III or IV at the time of enrollment
- Diagnosis of heart failure at least six weeks before enrollment
- Treatment with an ACE inhibitor and loop diuretic
- Left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Primary operable valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease
- Unstable angina, primary hepatic failure, active cancer
- Waitlisted or undergone heart transplantation
- Serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL, serum potassium >5.0 mmol/L
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Balanced characteristics between placebo and treatment groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients were randomized to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily or matching placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- All-cause mortality: 35% reduction in the spironolactone group compared to placebo (relative risk 0.70; P<0.001).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Cardiac mortality and hospitalization for cardiac reasons were significantly reduced in the spironolactone group.
- Improvement in symptoms based on NYHA functional class (P<0.001).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The long-term safety and efficacy of spironolactone in a broader range of heart failure patients or in those at lower risk were not assessed in this study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Supported by a grant from Searle (manufacturer of spironolactone).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The preliminary data from this study were presented at the AHA meeting in Dallas, November 8â€“11, 1998. </span></p>
