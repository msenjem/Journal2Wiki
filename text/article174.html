 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does the choice of insertion site for nontunneled central venous catheterization in ICU patients affect the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection and symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Subclavian-vein catheterization in ICU patients is associated with a lower risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection and symptomatic thrombosis compared to jugular-vein or femoral-vein catheterization, but carries a higher risk of mechanical complications, primarily pneumothorax.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The choice of insertion site for central venous catheters is critical given differential infection risks and mechanical complication profiles for subclavian, jugular, and femoral veins. This study, known as the 3SITES study, determined that subclavian-vein catheterization offers a lower risk of bloodstream infection and thrombosis but a higher risk of pneumothorax when compared with insertion at other sites in ICU patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) recommends using a subclavian site over a jugular or femoral site in adult patients to minimize infection risk.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.
- N=3,471 catheters in 3,027 adult ICU patients.
- Intervention: Nontunneled central venous catheterization at subclavian, jugular, or femoral vein.
- Allocation: 1:1:1 ratio when all sites suitable (three-choice scheme), 1:1 ratio when two sites suitable (two-choice scheme).
- Setting: Four university-affiliated hospitals and five general hospitals representing 10 ICUs in France.
- Enrollment: December 2011 through June 2014.
- Follow-up: Until ICU discharge or death.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Patients â‰¥18 years of age admitted to ICU with need for nontunneled central venous catheter accessible via at least two of three veins (subclavian, jugular, femoral).
- Exclusion Criteria: Patients without suitable sites for two or more of the designated veins.
- Baseline Characteristics: Well balanced between groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients were randomly assigned to have a nontunneled central venous catheter inserted into either the subclavian, jugular, or femoral vein.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Incidence of major catheter-related complications, defined as combined risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection and symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis.
- Secondary Outcomes: Time to catheter-tip colonization, time to total deep-vein thrombosis, and major mechanical complications (grade 3 or higher).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Use of ultrasonographic guidance as an insertion aid was not randomized, which could have influenced risk assessments for mechanical and infectious complications.
- Chlorhexidine bathing and chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings were not utilized, leaving their potential effect unassessed.
- The study did not involve the use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Supported by a grant from the Hospital Program for Clinical Research, French Ministry of Health.
- CareFusion provided chlorhexidine products free of charge.
