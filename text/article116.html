 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does digoxin therapy affect overall mortality and rate of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure and normal sinus rhythm?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Digoxin therapy did not reduce overall mortality in patients with chronic heart failure but was associated with a reduced rate of hospitalization both overall and for worsening heart failure, more precisely defining the role of digoxin in chronic heart failure management.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Despite digoxin being widely prescribed for heart failure treatment, uncertainties persisted about its long-term safety and efficacy. The study aimed to assess digoxin's impact on mortality and hospitalization over 3 to 5 years in patients with heart failure and normal sinus rhythm.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Not addressed in the provided article.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In the main trial, patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.45 or less, while in the ancillary trial, patients possessed ejection fractions greater than 0.45.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
Chronic heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤0.45 for main or >0.45 for ancillary trial, normal sinus rhythm.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
Not specified in the provided excerpt.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
No significant differences between digoxin and placebo groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to receive digoxin or placebo alongside diuretics and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
In the primary trial, no significant difference in overall mortality between digoxin and placebo groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In digoxin group compared to placebo: Fewer hospitalizations for worsening heart failure; trend toward a decrease in risk of death attributed to heart failure; reduction in hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes; increased suspected digoxin toxicity resulted in hospitalization (but low overall).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was organized and conducted by a Steering Committee representing various institutions, with the drug and placebo supplied by Glaxo Wellcome.
