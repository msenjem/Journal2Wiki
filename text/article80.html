 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">For patients with diabetes and advanced coronary artery disease, CABG was superior to PCI in that it significantly reduced rates of death and myocardial infarction, with a higher rate of stroke.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In the FREEDOM trial, patients with diabetes and predominantly three-vessel coronary artery disease were assigned to undergo either PCI with drug-eluting stents or CABG. After a median follow-up of 3.8 years, the primary composite outcome of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke occurred more frequently in the PCI group than in the CABG group. The advantage of CABG was primarily due to lower rates of myocardial infarction and death from any cause.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As a result of this study, guidelines may recommend CABG as the preferred revascularization strategy for patients with diabetes with multivessel coronary artery disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N=1,900 patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease
- PCI with drug-eluting stents vs. CABG
- Median follow-up: 3.8 years
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Patients with diabetes, angiographically confirmed multivessel coronary artery disease (>70% stenosis), without left main coronary stenosis
- Baseline Characteristics: Mean age 63.1 years, 29% women, 83% had three-vessel disease
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were assigned to undergo PCI with drug-eluting stents or CABG following recommended medical therapies for cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycated hemoglobin control.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcomes: Higher rate of primary composite outcome in PCI (26.6%) compared with CABG (18.7%) at 5 years; P=0.005.
- Secondary Outcomes: Higher mortality in PCI group (16.3%) versus CABG group (10.9%) at 5 years; stroke was more frequent in CABG group at 5 years (PCI 2.4%, CABG 5.2%); major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events at 1 year were higher in PCI (16.8%) than in CABG (11.8%).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Prespecified subgroups had very low prevalence which may affect the ability to detect interactions.
- The study was unblinded which could lead to potential treatment biases. However, outcomes were objectively and independently adjudicated.
- The trial was not powered to detect a difference in all-cause mortality.
