    "CABG vs. PCI in Diabetes with Multivessel Disease".The New England Journal of Medicine. 2012. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1211585.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease, is coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) superior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents in reducing the rates of death and myocardial infarction?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
For patients with diabetes and advanced coronary artery disease, CABG was superior to PCI in that it significantly reduced rates of death and myocardial infarction, with a higher rate of stroke.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As a result of this study, guidelines may recommend CABG as the preferred revascularization strategy for patients with diabetes with multivessel coronary artery disease.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial<br/>
- N=1,900 patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease<br/>
- PCI with drug-eluting stents vs. CABG<br/>
- Median follow-up: 3.8 years<br/>
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat<br/>
- Primary outcome: Composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Patients with diabetes, angiographically confirmed multivessel coronary artery disease (&gt;70% stenosis), without left main coronary stenosis<br/>
- Baseline Characteristics: Mean age 63.1 years, 29% women, 83% had three-vessel disease<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients were assigned to undergo PCI with drug-eluting stents or CABG following recommended medical therapies for cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycated hemoglobin control.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcomes: Higher rate of primary composite outcome in PCI (26.6%) compared with CABG (18.7%) at 5 years; P=0.005.<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes: Higher mortality in PCI group (16.3%) versus CABG group (10.9%) at 5 years; stroke was more frequent in CABG group at 5 years (PCI 2.4%, CABG 5.2%); major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events at 1 year were higher in PCI (16.8%) than in CABG (11.8%).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Prespecified subgroups had very low prevalence which may affect the ability to detect interactions.<br/>
- The study was unblinded which could lead to potential treatment biases. However, outcomes were objectively and independently adjudicated.<br/>
- The trial was not powered to detect a difference in all-cause mortality.<br/>
