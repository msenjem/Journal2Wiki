<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does the combination of the long-acting beta-agonist salmeterol and the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate reduce mortality among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
The combination of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality in COPD when compared to placebo. It did, however, reduce exacerbations and improve health status and lung function.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines for the management of COPD recommend combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists for patients with frequent exacerbations.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
A total of 6,112 patients with a history of smoking and moderate to severe COPD participated.<br/>
<br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
- Age 40 to 80 years<br/>
- History of smoking with at least a 10-pack-year history<br/>
- Diagnosed COPD with post-bronchodilator FEV1 less than 60% of the predicted value and less than a 10% increase in FEV1 post 400 μg albuterol administration<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
- Patients previously on certain COPD medications and those with other significant respiratory disorders were excluded.<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
- Mean age was 65 years<br/>
- Mean FEV1 was 44% of the predicted value<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients were randomized to receive either a combination of salmeterol (50 μg) and fluticasone propionate (500 μg) twice daily, salmeterol alone, fluticasone propionate alone, or placebo.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcomes<br/>
- 12.6% mortality in the combination therapy group vs. 15.2% in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.825; 95% CI, 0.681 to 1.002; P=0.052)<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Reduction in exacerbations frequency and improvement in health status and spirometric values were observed with combination therapy compared to placebo (P&lt;0.001)<br/>
- The incidence of pneumonia was higher among patients receiving fluticasone-containing treatments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The observed reduction in mortality did not reach predetermined statistical significance.<br/>
- High withdrawal rates, particularly in the placebo group, may have affected results.<br/>
- The trial may have been underpowered to detect a mortality benefit.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The trial was funded by GlaxoSmithKline.<br/>
