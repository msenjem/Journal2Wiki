 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The combination of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality in COPD when compared to placebo. It did, however, reduce exacerbations and improve health status and lung function.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most treatments focus on symptomatic relief, and aside from smoking cessation and oxygen therapy in chronic hypoxemia, few therapies have been shown to impact survival. The TORCH (Towards a Revolution in COPD Health) trial evaluated if the combination of the long-acting beta-agonist salmeterol and the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate could reduce mortality compared to placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines for the management of COPD recommend combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists for patients with frequent exacerbations.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The TORCH trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a duration of 3 years. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, and secondary endpoints included exacerbation frequency, health status as measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, and spirometric values.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A total of 6,112 patients with a history of smoking and moderate to severe COPD participated.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age 40 to 80 years
- History of smoking with at least a 10-pack-year history
- Diagnosed COPD with post-bronchodilator FEV1 less than 60% of the predicted value and less than a 10% increase in FEV1 post 400 μg albuterol administration
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Patients previously on certain COPD medications and those with other significant respiratory disorders were excluded.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age was 65 years
- Mean FEV1 was 44% of the predicted value
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to receive either a combination of salmeterol (50 μg) and fluticasone propionate (500 μg) twice daily, salmeterol alone, fluticasone propionate alone, or placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- 12.6% mortality in the combination therapy group vs. 15.2% in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.825; 95% CI, 0.681 to 1.002; P=0.052)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Reduction in exacerbations frequency and improvement in health status and spirometric values were observed with combination therapy compared to placebo (P<0.001)
- The incidence of pneumonia was higher among patients receiving fluticasone-containing treatments.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The observed reduction in mortality did not reach predetermined statistical significance.
- High withdrawal rates, particularly in the placebo group, may have affected results.
- The trial may have been underpowered to detect a mortality benefit.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by GlaxoSmithKline.
