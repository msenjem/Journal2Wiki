    "Clinical Question"<br/>
In patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, does early intervention with lenalidomide and dexamethasone delay progression to active disease and improve overall survival compared to observation?<br/>
<br/>
"Bottom Line"<br/>
Early treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma significantly delays progression to symptomatic disease and improves overall survival with manageable toxicity.<br/>
<br/>
"Major Points"<br/>
- Standard care for smoldering multiple myeloma has been observation until symptoms develop. However, this does not identify high-risk patients who may benefit from early intervention.<br/>
- This phase 3 study randomized 119 high-risk smoldering myeloma patients to early treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone followed by maintenance lenalidomide or to observation.<br/>
- Early treatment significantly increased time to progression to symptomatic myeloma and overall survival rate at 3 years (94% vs. 80%).<br/>
- Response rates were high, with 79% after induction phase and 90% during the maintenance phase.<br/>
- Treatment toxic effects were mainly low-grade, consisting primarily of grade 1 or 2 infections, asthenia, and hematologic adverse events.<br/>
<br/>
"Guidelines"<br/>
As of the knowledge cutoff date, there are no updated guidelines reflecting the results of this study.<br/>
<br/>
"Design"<br/>
- Open-label, phase 3 randomized controlled trial<br/>
- N=119<br/>
- Early treatment (n=57)<br/>
- Observation (n=62)<br/>
- Median follow-up: 40 months<br/>
<br/>
"Population"<br/>
- Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma within the previous 5 years.<br/>
- Exclusion criteria: Symptoms of active myeloma such as hypercalcemia, bone lesions, renal failure, or anemia.<br/>
<br/>
"Interventions"<br/>
- Treatment: 9 cycles of lenalidomide (25 mg/day for days 1-21) and dexamethasone (20 mg/day on days 1-4 and 12-15), followed by maintenance with lenalidomide (10 mg/day on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) for 2 years.<br/>
- Observation: No treatment until progression to symptomatic disease.<br/>
<br/>
"Outcomes"<br/>
- Primary: Time to progression to symptomatic disease.<br/>
- Secondary: Response rate, overall survival, and safety.<br/>
<br/>
"Criticisms"<br/>
- Open-label design may introduce bias.<br/>
- Did not assess the quality of life impact of early treatment.<br/>
- Some patients received other treatments off-protocol at the time of symptomatic progression. <br/>
<br/>
"Funding"<br/>
The study was funded by Celgene with an unrestricted grant.<br/>
<br/>
