 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does the use of high-dose intravenous omeprazole after endoscopic treatment for bleeding peptic ulcers reduce the rate of recurrent bleeding?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The use of high-dose intravenous omeprazole following successful endoscopic treatment for bleeding peptic ulcers significantly reduces the risk of recurrent bleeding within the next 30 days.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Bleeding peptic ulcers have a high rate of recurrence despite successful endoscopic treatment, and subsequent bleeding is associated with a high mortality rate. Stabilization of blood clots within the ulcer may be facilitated by neutral gastric pH, which can be achieved using a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Contemporary guidelines for the management of peptic ulcer bleeding recommend the use of PPIs but may not specify the dosing strategy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
- N=240 patients with bleeding peptic ulcers.
- High-dose omeprazole (intravenous bolus of 80 mg followed by an infusion of 8 mg per hour for 72 hours) vs. placebo.
- After the infusion, all patients were given 20 mg of oral omeprazole per day for eight weeks.
- Enrollment: May 1998 to July 1999.
- Follow-up: 30 days post-endoscopy, with outpatients reevaluated at eight weeks.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: 
- Patients aged 16 and older.
- Successful endoscopic treatment of actively bleeding ulcers or ulcers with nonbleeding visible vessels (after stabilization if in shock or vomiting fresh blood).
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Failed endoscopic treatment requiring immediate surgery.
- Patients with terminal cancer, moribund due to concomitant illness, or who did not provide consent.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics:
- Patients were similar in demographics, types of coexisting illnesses, severity of bleeding, risk factors for ulcers, and other relevant factors with no significant differences between groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Intravenous infusion of placebo or omeprazole (80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg per hour for 72 hours).
- Followed by 20 mg of oral omeprazole per day for eight weeks.
- Patients with H. pylori received an additional combination therapy for eradication.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes:
- Recurrent bleeding within 30 days after endoscopy.
- Recurrence rate: 6.7% in the omeprazole group vs. 22.5% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.7 to 9.0).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Significantly fewer surgical interventions and a shorter hospital stay were observed in the omeprazole group.
- Reduction in rates of retreatment and blood transfusions were seen with omeprazole.
- Deaths within 30 days after endoscopy were not statistically different (4.2% in the omeprazole group vs. 10% in the placebo group; P=0.13).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported in full by a grant from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">For additional information and context, further reading includes comprehensive guidelines on the management of peptic ulcer bleeding, as well as other related clinical trials and meta-analyses exploring the benefits of proton-pump inhibitors in this patient population. </span></p>
