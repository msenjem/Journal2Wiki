<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does the use of high-dose intravenous omeprazole after endoscopic treatment for bleeding peptic ulcers reduce the rate of recurrent bleeding?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
The use of high-dose intravenous omeprazole following successful endoscopic treatment for bleeding peptic ulcers significantly reduces the risk of recurrent bleeding within the next 30 days.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Bleeding peptic ulcers have a high rate of recurrence despite successful endoscopic treatment, and subsequent bleeding is associated with a high mortality rate. Stabilization of blood clots within the ulcer may be facilitated by neutral gastric pH, which can be achieved using a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). <br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Contemporary guidelines for the management of peptic ulcer bleeding recommend the use of PPIs but may not specify the dosing strategy.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.<br/>
- N=240 patients with bleeding peptic ulcers.<br/>
- High-dose omeprazole (intravenous bolus of 80 mg followed by an infusion of 8 mg per hour for 72 hours) vs. placebo.<br/>
- After the infusion, all patients were given 20 mg of oral omeprazole per day for eight weeks.<br/>
- Enrollment: May 1998 to July 1999.<br/>
- Follow-up: 30 days post-endoscopy, with outpatients reevaluated at eight weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria: <br/>
- Patients aged 16 and older.<br/>
- Successful endoscopic treatment of actively bleeding ulcers or ulcers with nonbleeding visible vessels (after stabilization if in shock or vomiting fresh blood).<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Failed endoscopic treatment requiring immediate surgery.<br/>
- Patients with terminal cancer, moribund due to concomitant illness, or who did not provide consent.<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics:<br/>
- Patients were similar in demographics, types of coexisting illnesses, severity of bleeding, risk factors for ulcers, and other relevant factors with no significant differences between groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Intravenous infusion of placebo or omeprazole (80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg per hour for 72 hours).<br/>
- Followed by 20 mg of oral omeprazole per day for eight weeks.<br/>
- Patients with H. pylori received an additional combination therapy for eradication.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcomes:<br/>
- Recurrent bleeding within 30 days after endoscopy.<br/>
- Recurrence rate: 6.7% in the omeprazole group vs. 22.5% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.7 to 9.0).<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes:<br/>
- Significantly fewer surgical interventions and a shorter hospital stay were observed in the omeprazole group.<br/>
- Reduction in rates of retreatment and blood transfusions were seen with omeprazole.<br/>
- Deaths within 30 days after endoscopy were not statistically different (4.2% in the omeprazole group vs. 10% in the placebo group; P=0.13).<br/>
