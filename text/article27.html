 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, how does transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) compare with surgical aortic-valve replacement (SAVR) in terms of mortality and morbidity?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, TAVR is comparable to SAVR in terms of survival at 1 year with differences in periprocedural risks.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial included a cohort of high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, for whom SAVR was applicable but with substantial risk. This study demonstrated that TAVR, delivered either by the transfemoral or transapical approach, was a viable alternative to SAVR, showing similar rates of survival at 1 year.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines for the treatment of aortic stenosis have incorporated results from the PARTNER trial, including recommendations for TAVR in patients at high risk for surgical complications.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N=699 high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis
- Randomized to TAVR (n=348) or SAVR (n=351)
- Intention-to-treat analysis
- Primary end point: Death from any cause at 1 year
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Severe aortic stenosis with cardiac symptoms (NYHA class II or worse)
- High risk for operative complications or death with predicted 30-day mortality of at least 15%
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Bicuspid or noncalcified valve
- Severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <20%)
- Need for revascularization
- Severe valvular regurgitation
- Recent neurologic event
- Severe renal insufficiency
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Balanced between groups
- High STS score indicating operative risk
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients were randomized to undergo either TAVR via transfemoral or transapical access or SAVR.
- Heparin administered during the procedure and dual antiplatelet therapy for 6 months post-procedure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- 1-year mortality: 24.2% in TAVR group vs. 26.8% in SAVR group (P=0.44) 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Major stroke at 1 year: 5.1% in TAVR group vs. 2.4% in SAVR group (P=0.07)
- Differences in periprocedural complications with more vascular complications in TAVR and more bleeding and atrial fibrillation in SAVR.
- Improvement in functional class and 6-minute walk distance at 1-year with no significant difference between groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Withdrawals and decisions against the procedure were more frequent in SAVR group, affecting early procedure-related outcomes assessment.
- Long-term valve durability data pending.
- Increased stroke rate associated with the TAVR procedure.
- Trial used an early device version and included centers with no prior experience with the procedure.
