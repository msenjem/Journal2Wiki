<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, how does transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) compare with surgical aortic-valve replacement (SAVR) in terms of mortality and morbidity?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line </strong></h2><br/>
In high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, TAVR is comparable to SAVR in terms of survival at 1 year with differences in periprocedural risks.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
The PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial included a cohort of high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, for whom SAVR was applicable but with substantial risk. This study demonstrated that TAVR, delivered either by the transfemoral or transapical approach, was a viable alternative to SAVR, showing similar rates of survival at 1 year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines for the treatment of aortic stenosis have incorporated results from the PARTNER trial, including recommendations for TAVR in patients at high risk for surgical complications.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial<br/>
- N=699 high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis<br/>
- Randomized to TAVR (n=348) or SAVR (n=351)<br/>
- Intention-to-treat analysis<br/>
- Primary end point: Death from any cause at 1 year<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
- Severe aortic stenosis with cardiac symptoms (NYHA class II or worse)<br/>
- High risk for operative complications or death with predicted 30-day mortality of at least 15%<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
- Bicuspid or noncalcified valve<br/>
- Severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;20%)<br/>
- Need for revascularization<br/>
- Severe valvular regurgitation<br/>
- Recent neurologic event<br/>
- Severe renal insufficiency<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
- Balanced between groups<br/>
- High STS score indicating operative risk<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Patients were randomized to undergo either TAVR via transfemoral or transapical access or SAVR.<br/>
- Heparin administered during the procedure and dual antiplatelet therapy for 6 months post-procedure.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
- 1-year mortality: 24.2% in TAVR group vs. 26.8% in SAVR group (P=0.44) <br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
- Major stroke at 1 year: 5.1% in TAVR group vs. 2.4% in SAVR group (P=0.07)<br/>
- Differences in periprocedural complications with more vascular complications in TAVR and more bleeding and atrial fibrillation in SAVR.<br/>
- Improvement in functional class and 6-minute walk distance at 1-year with no significant difference between groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Withdrawals and decisions against the procedure were more frequent in SAVR group, affecting early procedure-related outcomes assessment.<br/>
- Long-term valve durability data pending.<br/>
- Increased stroke rate associated with the TAVR procedure.<br/>
- Trial used an early device version and included centers with no prior experience with the procedure.<br/>
