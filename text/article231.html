    "Thromboprophylaxis with Rivaroxaban in High-Risk Ambulatory Patients with Cancer". The New England Journal of Medicine. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02555878.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban in high-risk ambulatory patients with cancer reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism or death due to venous thromboembolism?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban did not result in a significantly lower incidence of venous thromboembolism or death due to venous thromboembolism over a 180-day trial period when compared to placebo in high-risk ambulatory patients with cancer. However, during the intervention period, rivaroxaban led to a substantially lower incidence of such events, with a low incidence of major bleeding.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current guidelines do not routinely recommend thromboprophylaxis for ambulatory patients with cancer due to a lack of evidence and concerns about bleeding risks.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 841 patients randomized; 420 received rivaroxaban (10 mg/day) and 421 received placebo for up to 180 days.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Included ambulatory patients with a solid tumor or lymphoma, Khorana score of â‰¥2, expected survival of more than 6 months, and starting a new systemic cancer therapy. Excluded those with primary brain tumors or known brain metastases, poor performance status, active bleeding, high bleeding risk.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients receiving rivaroxaban (10 mg) or placebo daily for up to 180 days.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary efficacy end point: Composite of objectively confirmed proximal deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, and death from venous thromboembolism up to day 180.<br/>
- Primary safety end point: Major bleeding as defined by ISTH criteria.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
Nearly 47% of patients discontinued the trial regimen prematurely, although discontinuation rates were similar across both groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
Funded by Janssen and Bayer.<br/>
