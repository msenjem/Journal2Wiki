    "A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Arthroscopy for Osteoarthritis of the Knee"<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does arthroscopic surgery improve pain and function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee more than placebo surgery?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Arthroscopic lavage and débridement did not result in improved pain or function when compared with placebo surgery for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Arthroscopic surgery is a common intervention for knee osteoarthritis, yet its efficacy compared to placebo had not been rigorously evaluated. This randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 180 patients found no difference in pain relief or improved function between those who underwent arthroscopic lavage or débridement and those who received placebo surgery over a 24-month period.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Current clinical practice guidelines have moved away from recommending arthroscopic interventions like lavage and débridement for knee osteoarthritis, focusing instead on non-surgical approaches such as physical therapy, weight loss, and pain management.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial<br/>
- N=180 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee<br/>
- Interventions: arthroscopic débridement, arthroscopic lavage, or placebo surgery<br/>
- Follow-up period: 24 months<br/>
- Primary outcomes: self-reported knee pain severity and functional assessment; objective test of walking and stair climbing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion criteria: Patients ≤75 years with osteoarthritis of the knee, experiencing moderate to severe knee pain despite 6 months of medical treatment, and no arthroscopy in the previous 2 years.<br/>
- Exclusion criteria: Severe osteoarthritis (grade ≥9), severe deformity, and serious medical problems.<br/>
- 165 patients completed the trial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Arthroscopic débridement: involved joint lavage with 10 liters of fluid, removal of loose debris, trimming of torn meniscal fragments, and smoothing of meniscus and articular cartilage.<br/>
- Arthroscopic lavage: 10 liters of fluid lavage without mechanical débridement or tissue removal, except in cases of mechanically unstable meniscal tears.<br/>
- Placebo surgery: simulated arthroscopic procedure without arthroscopic insertion or tissue removal.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary: Knee pain at 24 months using the Knee-Specific Pain Scale (KSPS)<br/>
- Secondary: Additional assessments of pain and function including scales from the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS2-P and AIMS2-WB) and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36-P and SF-36-PF), as well as an objective Physical Functioning Scale (PFS).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- Study participants were mostly men, as trials were conducted at a Veterans Affairs medical center, potentially limiting generalizability.<br/>
- High refusal rate of eligible patients, possibly due to knowing the one-in-three chance of undergoing a placebo procedure, may have introduced selection bias.<br/>
- All procedures performed by a single surgeon, though highly skilled, could affect the applicability of the results to other surgeons' practices.<br/>
