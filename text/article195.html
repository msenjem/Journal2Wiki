    "Drotrecogin Alfa (Activated) in Adults with Septic Shock".The New England Journal of Medicine. 2012.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA) reduce mortality in adults with septic shock?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Drotrecogin alfa (activated) did not significantly reduce mortality at 28 or 90 days compared to placebo in adults with septic shock.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
Drotrecogin alfa (activated) was approved for use in severe sepsis patients with a high risk of death. However, post-approval studies failed to demonstrate benefits for less severely ill adults and children, leading to further scrutiny and the need for this study.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Included 1697 adult patients with infection, systemic inflammation, and shock, receiving a threshold dose of fluids and vasopressors for at least 4 hours.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients randomly assigned to receive DrotAA (24 Î¼g per kg per hour) or placebo for 96 hours.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
The primary outcome was death from any cause at 28 days after randomization.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
At 28 days, mortality was 26.4% in DrotAA group vs. 24.2% in the placebo group (relative risk 1.09; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.28; P=0.31). Mortality at 90 days was 34.1% for DrotAA vs. 32.7% for placebo (relative risk 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.19; P=0.56).<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
The study was limited by the lack of in-depth analysis of coagulation or inflammatory responses to the study drugs, which was available from previous trials. Mortality in the placebo group was lower than expected but similar to other contemporary studies.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
The study was funded by Eli Lilly.<br/>
