<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Is oral antibiotic therapy noninferior to intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of bone or joint infection?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Oral antibiotic therapy was noninferior to intravenous antibiotic therapy for the initial 6 weeks of treatment for bone and joint infection when assessed for treatment failure at 1 year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As a result of this trial, a standard care practice which favored intravenous antibiotics for bone and joint infections may be re-evaluated, although patient and pathogen-specific factors must be taken into account for therapy decisions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial<br/>
- N=1,054 participants<br/>
- 6 weeks initial treatment period followed by a 1-year assessment for treatment failure<br/>
- Intravenous antibiotics (n=527) vs. oral antibiotics (n=527)<br/>
- Enrollment: June 2010 - October 2015<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Participants: Adults being treated for bone or joint infection<br/>
- Inclusion criteria: Age over 18 years, with bone or joint infection, and consent provided<br/>
- Exclusion criteria: Infection not managed by surgical intervention within 7 days after the start of antibiotic therapy<br/>
- Baseline characteristics: Well-matched for age, gender, infection type, and other variables<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Intravenous group: Intravenous antibiotics for the first 6 weeks<br/>
- Oral group: Oral antibiotics for the first 6 weeks<br/>
- Follow-on oral antibiotics were permitted post-6-weeks in both groups<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary Outcome: Definitive treatment failure within 1 year after randomization<br/>
- Secondary Outcomes: Early discontinuation of treatment, catheter complications, serious adverse events, the length of hospital stay, adherence to treatment, and patient-reported outcome measures<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The trial was open-label and not blinded<br/>
- Selection of appropriate oral agents relied on specialist oversight, which may not be consistently applied across different healthcare settings<br/>
- Study duration was only 1 year, thus later treatment failures beyond this period may not have been captured<br/>
