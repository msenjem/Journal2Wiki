 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Oral antibiotic therapy was noninferior to intravenous antibiotic therapy for the initial 6 weeks of treatment for bone and joint infection when assessed for treatment failure at 1 year.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The standard treatment for complex bone and joint infections typically includes a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics. The OVIVA trial examined whether oral antibiotic therapy for the first 6 weeks is noninferior to intravenous therapy in adults being treated for bone or joint infection. The trial found that oral therapy was indeed noninferior to intravenous therapy based on rates of definitive treatment failure within 1 year after randomization. Additionally, oral therapy was associated with shorter hospital stays and fewer complications related to intravenous catheters.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As a result of this trial, a standard care practice which favored intravenous antibiotics for bone and joint infections may be re-evaluated, although patient and pathogen-specific factors must be taken into account for therapy decisions.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial
- N=1,054 participants
- 6 weeks initial treatment period followed by a 1-year assessment for treatment failure
- Intravenous antibiotics (n=527) vs. oral antibiotics (n=527)
- Enrollment: June 2010 - October 2015
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Participants: Adults being treated for bone or joint infection
- Inclusion criteria: Age over 18 years, with bone or joint infection, and consent provided
- Exclusion criteria: Infection not managed by surgical intervention within 7 days after the start of antibiotic therapy
- Baseline characteristics: Well-matched for age, gender, infection type, and other variables
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Intravenous group: Intravenous antibiotics for the first 6 weeks
- Oral group: Oral antibiotics for the first 6 weeks
- Follow-on oral antibiotics were permitted post-6-weeks in both groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Definitive treatment failure within 1 year after randomization
- Secondary Outcomes: Early discontinuation of treatment, catheter complications, serious adverse events, the length of hospital stay, adherence to treatment, and patient-reported outcome measures
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial was open-label and not blinded
- Selection of appropriate oral agents relied on specialist oversight, which may not be consistently applied across different healthcare settings
- Study duration was only 1 year, thus later treatment failures beyond this period may not have been captured
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- National Institute for Health Research
- NIHR Imperial College Biomedical Research Centre
