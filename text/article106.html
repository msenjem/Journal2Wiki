 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The addition of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine to standard therapy, including neurohormonal blockers, significantly increased survival and improved quality of life among black patients with advanced heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) demonstrated that a combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine added to standard heart failure therapy, including neurohormonal inhibitors, was effective in reducing mortality and improving quality of life in black patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As a result of the study findings, guidelines may now endorse the combination of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine as part of standard therapy for black patients with advanced heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial
- Patients recruited from 161 centers in the United States
- Enrollment: 1050 black patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure with dilated ventricles
- Interventions: Fixed dose of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine vs. placebo, in addition to standard therapy
- Follow-up: Up to 18 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Black patients aged 18 and older
- NYHA class III or IV heart failure for at least three months
- Left ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤35% or <45% with increased left ventricular internal end-diastolic diameter
- Stable doses of standard therapy for heart failure, including neurohormonal blockers
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, or stroke within the preceding three months
- Cardiac surgery or intervention within the preceding three months
- Significant valvular disease, hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy, uncontrolled hypertension, and other specific cardiac conditions
- Pregnancy, nursing, not using effective contraception if of childbearing age
- Life expectancy-limiting illness other than heart failure
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics:
- Mean age, gender distribution, and baseline comorbid conditions were balanced between the two groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine or placebo
- Initially one tablet containing either 37.5 mg of hydralazine hydrochloride and 20 mg of isosorbide dinitrate or placebo three times daily
- Increased to two tablets three times daily
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes:
- Primary endpoint was a composite score consisting of death from any cause, a first hospitalization for heart failure, and change in quality of life
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Individual components of the primary composite score
- Cardiovascular death
- Total number and days of hospitalization
- Quality of life over the trial
- Unscheduled healthcare visits
- Change in B-type natriuretic peptide level
- Need for cardiac transplantation
- Change in left ventricular ejection fraction, internal diastolic dimension, and wall thickness
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by NitroMed.
