 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does rosuvastatin treatment reduce the incidence of major cardiovascular events in men and women with normal LDL levels but elevated C-reactive protein?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events in apparently healthy persons with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and without hyperlipidemia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The JUPITER trial showed that in healthy adults with normal LDL but elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), treatment with rosuvastatin significantly reduced rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, and cardiovascular death. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Updated guidelines should consider rosuvastatin therapy for primary prevention in individuals with elevated CRP.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
- N=17,802
- Rosuvastatin 20mg daily (n=8,901) vs. placebo (n=8,901)
- Median follow-up: 1.9 years (maximum: 5.0 years)
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Occurrence of major cardiovascular events defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Men ≥50 years and women ≥60 years with no history of cardiovascular disease, LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥2.0 mg/L
- Exclusion Criteria: Previous use of lipid-lowering therapy, postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, hepatic dysfunction, creatinine kinase >3x upper limit, diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, inflammatory diseases, or recent drug/alcohol abuse.
- Baseline Characteristics: Varied population including 38.2% women and 25.2% Black or Hispanic; median LDL cholesterol 108 mg/dL.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily or matching placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Rosuvastatin reduced the rate of the primary endpoint by 44% compared to placebo (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.46-0.69; P<0.00001).
- Secondary Outcomes: Significant reductions in the rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, and unstable angina. Modest but significant reduction in all-cause mortality with rosuvastatin.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Early termination of the trial might have underestimated the rates of adverse events.
- Increased rate of physician-reported diabetes in the rosuvastatin group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by AstraZeneca.
