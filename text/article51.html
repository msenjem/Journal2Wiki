    "Hypothermia vs. Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest".<br/>
<br/>
The New England Journal of Medicine. Full Article can be accessed through NEJM.org<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does targeted hypothermia improve survival and functional outcomes in adults with coma who have experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest compared with targeted normothermia?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Targeted hypothermia did not result in a lower incidence of death at 6 months compared to targeted normothermia in patients with coma after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
- Open-label, randomized, superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment<br/>
- N=1,900 adults in coma after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac or unknown cause<br/>
- Targeted hypothermia at 33°C with controlled rewarming (n=930)<br/>
- Targeted normothermia with early treatment of fever (n=931)<br/>
- Enrollment: November 2017 – January 2020<br/>
- Primary outcome: All-cause mortality at 6 months<br/>
- Secondary outcomes: Functional outcomes at 6 months using the modified Rankin scale, number of days alive and out of the hospital, survival analysis, and quality of life assessed by EQ-5D-5L<br/>
- Prespecified adverse events: Pneumonia, sepsis, bleeding, arrhythmia with hemodynamic compromise, skin complications<br/>
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion criteria: Adults ≥18 years of age with presumed cardiac or unknown cause out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, coma, and no ability to obey verbal commands post-resuscitation<br/>
- Exclusion criteria: More than 180 minutes from return of spontaneous circulation to screening, unwitnessed cardiac arrest with initial asystole, care limitations<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
- Hypothermia group: Immediate cooling to target temperature of 33°C, maintained until 28 hours, followed by rewarming<br/>
- Normothermia group: Temperature maintained at ≤37.5°C, with temperature management devices initiated if body temperature reached ≥37.8°C<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
- Primary: At 6 months, death occurred in 50% of patients in the hypothermia group and 48% in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.14; P=0.37).<br/>
- Modified Rankin scale scores (0-6) indicating functional outcome were similar between groups at 6 months, with 55% in both groups experiencing moderately severe disability or worse.<br/>
- Outcomes were consistent across prespecified subgroups.<br/>
- Arrhythmias resulting in hemodynamic compromise were more common in the hypothermia group compared to the normothermia group.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The trial did not include a control group without any temperature management, leaving unanswered whether any management is superior to none.<br/>
- ICU staff were aware of temperature targets, which may have influenced care outside of the study parameters.<br/>
- The study was limited to out-of-hospital arrests due to presumed cardiac or unknown cause, so the results may not be fully generalizable to other types of cardiac arrest.<br/>
