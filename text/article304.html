<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
Does screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduce mortality from lung cancer?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
Screening with low-dose CT in persons at high risk for lung cancer results in a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality compared to screening with chest radiography.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving 53,454 participants considered at high risk for lung cancer who were randomized to three annual screenings with either low-dose CT or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Participants were aged 55-74, had a history of cigarette smoking of at least 30 pack-years, and, if former smokers, had quit within the previous 15 years. <br/>
<br/>
Inclusion Criteria<br/>
- Ages 55-74 at the time of randomization<br/>
- History of tobacco smoking of at least 30 pack-years<br/>
- If former smokers, cessation of smoking within the past 15 years<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria<br/>
- Previous lung cancer diagnosis<br/>
- Chest CT within 18 months prior to enrollment<br/>
- Hemoptysis or unexplained weight loss over 15 pounds in the preceding year<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
Participants were demographically similar, approximately 94% former or current smokers, generally reflecting a "healthy-volunteer" effect.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Participants were randomized to three annual screenings with either low-dose CT or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome<br/>
A 20% relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer was seen with low-dose CT screening. The number needed to screen to prevent one death from lung cancer was 320.<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes<br/>
Overall mortality was reduced by 6.7% in the low-dose CT group. There was a high rate of false positive results in both groups, but these mostly stemmed from benign findings.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms</strong></h2><br/>
- The “healthy-volunteer” effect may have biased results more favorably than in the community setting.<br/>
- Technological advancements in CT imaging may alter the effectiveness of screening.<br/>
- Trial conducted at expert centers, so results may not generalize to community facilities.<br/><br/>
- Potential harms include overdiagnosis and radiation exposure.<br/>
<br/>
