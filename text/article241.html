 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who have completed 6 to 18 months of oral anticoagulant treatment, does aspirin reduce the risk of recurrence without increasing the risk of major bleeding compared with placebo?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Aspirin reduces the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism by about 40% after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment, without a significant increase in major bleeding events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Approximately 20% of patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism experience a recurrence within two years of stopping oral anticoagulant therapy. The WARFASA trial found that 100mg of aspirin daily, initiated after 6 to 18 months of anticoagulant therapy, reduces the recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism, providing an alternative to indefinite anticoagulation in selected patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines may not yet reflect the findings of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=402 patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism
- Aspirin 100 mg daily (n=205) or placebo (n=197)
- Median follow-up: 24.6 months
- Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat
- Primary efficacy outcome: Recurrence of venous thromboembolism
- Primary safety outcome: Major bleeding
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age over 18 years
- Completed 6 to 18 months of vitamin K antagonist treatment for first-ever, unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Venous thromboembolism provoked by a known risk factor
- Patients with significant bleeding during initial anticoagulant treatment or with other conditions contraindicating aspirin use (see Supplementary Appendix for detailed criteria)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Demographics, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities balanced between the two groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Aspirin, 100 mg once daily, or placebo for 2 years, with the option to extend treatment
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 28 of the 205 patients in the aspirin group and in 43 of the 197 patients in the placebo group (6.6% vs. 11.2% per year; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.93; P=0.02)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Two major bleeding events, one in each treatment group
- Additional secondary efficacy outcomes included nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, acute ischemia of the lower limbs, and death from any cause
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- University of Perugia, grant-in-aid from Bayer HealthCare, and an Aventis Fellowship for Clinical Research from the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis.
