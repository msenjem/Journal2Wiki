 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients who had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke and a PFO, closure with the Amplatzer PFO Occluder device did not show a significant benefit over medical therapy alone in the primary intention-to-treat analysis. However, PFO closure was found to be superior to medical therapy alone in the prespecified per-protocol and as-treated analyses, with a low rate of associated risks.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The RESPECT trial was an exploratory study to determine if PFO closure is more effective than medical therapy alone in preventing recurrent ischemic stroke in young and middle-aged adults following a cryptogenic stroke. While primary intention-to-treat analysis did not show significant differences, secondary analyses indicated potential benefits of PFO closure with the Amplatzer PFO Occluder.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for PFO closure in patients with a cryptogenic stroke due to the mixed evidence from trials.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prospective, multicenter, randomized, event-driven trial comparing PFO closure to medical therapy alone.
N=980 patients enrolled at 69 sites.
Patients were 18 to 60 years of age with a history of cryptogenic ischemic stroke.
Randomization to PFO closure with the Amplatzer PFO Occluder or medical therapy only.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- 18 to 60 years of age
- Cryptogenic ischemic stroke
- PFO identified via transesophageal echocardiography
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Identifiable causes of stroke apart from paradoxical embolism
- Significant shunt or atrial septal defect
- Hypercoagulable states
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics:
- Mean age: 45.9 years
- 51.4% female
- Median follow-up: 2.1 years
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- PFO closure within 21 days after randomization
- Medical therapy allowed: aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel, or combined aspirin with extended-release dipyridamole
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes:
- Recurrent nonfatal ischemic stroke, fatal ischemic stroke, or early death after randomization
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Complete closure of PFO on the 6-month follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram
- Absence of recurrent symptomatic nonfatal ischemic stroke or cardiovascular death
- Absence of a transient ischemic attack
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Higher dropout rate in the medical-therapy group leading to unequal duration of exposure to the risk of recurrence
- The primary analysis not showing superiority of PFO closure
- Long-term protective benefit of closure remains uncertain due to modest absolute event reduction
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by St. Jude Medical.
