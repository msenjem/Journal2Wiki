 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Coronary-artery revascularization before elective major vascular surgery does not improve long-term survival or reduce perioperative cardiac complications in patients with stable coronary artery disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">According to prior guidelines, coronary-artery revascularization is recommended only if the patient has unstable symptoms or a survival benefit is expected from revascularization. A lack of consensus existed, likely due to limited data on preoperative coronary revascularization before vascular surgery.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">The CARP trial investigated if coronary-artery revascularization could improve long-term outcomes in patients scheduled for elective vascular operations and at increased risk for perioperative cardiac complications. The study found no significant difference in long-term mortality or perioperative myocardial infarction rates between revascularized and non-revascularized patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Based on this trial's results, current guidelines recommend that preoperative coronary-artery revascularization should be reserved for individuals with unstable cardiac symptoms or those proven to benefit from coronary-artery bypass grafting.

- N=510 patients with clinically significant coronary artery disease
- Interventions:
  - Preoperative coronary-artery revascularization (n=258)
  - No preoperative revascularization (n=252)
- Enrollment: March 1999 - February 2003
- Mean follow-up: 2.7 years
- Primary outcome: Long-term mortality
- Secondary outcomes: Myocardial infarction, stroke, limb loss, and dialysis
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Patients with an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm or severe arterial occlusive disease of the legs, scheduled for elective vascular surgery
- Increased risk for perioperative cardiac complications
- Coronary artery disease amenable to revascularization
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Urgent or emergency surgery required
- Severe concurrent illness
- Prior revascularization without recurrent ischemia

 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Long-term mortality: 22% in revascularization group vs. 23% in no-revascularization group (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.37; P=0.92)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Myocardial infarction within 30 days postoperatively: 12% with revascularization vs. 14% without revascularization (P=0.37)
