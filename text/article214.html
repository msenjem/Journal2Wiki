<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
In adult patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease naïve to immunosuppressives and biologics, is combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine more effective than either agent alone for inducing corticosteroid-free clinical remission?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
For adults with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease naïve to immunosuppressive or biologic therapy, combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine was more effective in inducing corticosteroid-free clinical remission than monotherapy with either agent.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder where progression may lead to complications. Corticosteroids, mesalamine, budesonide, azathioprine, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) such as infliximab are currently used to manage symptoms. Previous studies indicated individual benefits of infliximab and azathioprine, but their combined efficacy had not been evaluated in a naïve patient population.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
As of 2010, the American College of Gastroenterology recommended that infliximab could be considered for induction of remission in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease that does not respond to conventional treatments, and combination therapy with azathioprine may be used in some patients.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial<br/>
<br/>
N=508 adult patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions:</strong></h2><br/>
- Infliximab (5 mg/kg IV at weeks 0, 2, 6, then every 8 weeks) + placebo capsules<br/>
- Azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg orally daily) + placebo infusions<br/>
- Combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine<br/>
<br/>
Setting: 92 centers from March 2005 through November 2008<br/>
Enrollment: 2005-2008<br/>
Mean follow-up: 30 weeks with optional 20-week blinded extension<br/>
Analysis: Intention-to-treat<br/>
Primary outcome: Corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria:<br/>
- At least 21 years of age<br/>
- Diagnosed with Crohn's disease for at least 6 weeks<br/>
- CDAI score of 220 to 450<br/>
- Corticosteroid-dependent or under consideration for corticosteroids<br/>
<br/>
Exclusion Criteria:<br/>
- Previous treatment with azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, or any anti-TNF biologic agent<br/>
- Contraindications such as tuberculosis, hep B or C, short bowel syndrome, recent abdominal surgery, severe cardiac failure<br/>
<br/>
Baseline Characteristics<br/>
Demographics and disease characteristics were similar across all groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
Patients were randomized to one of three groups and received study medication through week 30 with the option to continue in a blinded study extension through week 50.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome:<br/>
- Corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26: 56.8% (combination), 44.4% (infliximab), 30.0% (azathioprine)<br/>
<br/>
Secondary Outcomes:<br/>
- Mucosal healing at week 26: 43.9% (combination), 30.1% (infliximab), 16.5% (azathioprine)<br/>
- Higher corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 50 for the combination therapy group compared to azathioprine alone<br/>
- Similar rates of adverse events among all treatment groups<br/>
<br/>
