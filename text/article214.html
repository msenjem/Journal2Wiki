 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In adult patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease naïve to immunosuppressives and biologics, is combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine more effective than either agent alone for inducing corticosteroid-free clinical remission?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">For adults with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease naïve to immunosuppressive or biologic therapy, combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine was more effective in inducing corticosteroid-free clinical remission than monotherapy with either agent.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder where progression may lead to complications. Corticosteroids, mesalamine, budesonide, azathioprine, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) such as infliximab are currently used to manage symptoms. Previous studies indicated individual benefits of infliximab and azathioprine, but their combined efficacy had not been evaluated in a naïve patient population.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">This study (SONIC) found that combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine was more effective at achieving corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26 compared to monotherapy with either drug. Mucosal healing at 26 weeks was also highest in the combination group compared to either monotherapy. Outcomes at week 50 supported the superiority of combination therapy, with higher rates of corticosteroid-free clinical remission versus azathioprine alone. Rates of adverse events were similar among treatment groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of 2010, the American College of Gastroenterology recommended that infliximab could be considered for induction of remission in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease that does not respond to conventional treatments, and combination therapy with azathioprine may be used in some patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
 </span></p><p><span class="main">N=508 adult patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Infliximab (5 mg/kg IV at weeks 0, 2, 6, then every 8 weeks) + placebo capsules
- Azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg orally daily) + placebo infusions
- Combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Setting: 92 centers from March 2005 through November 2008
Enrollment: 2005-2008
Mean follow-up: 30 weeks with optional 20-week blinded extension
Analysis: Intention-to-treat
Primary outcome: Corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- At least 21 years of age
- Diagnosed with Crohn's disease for at least 6 weeks
- CDAI score of 220 to 450

Demographics and disease characteristics were similar across all groups.

- Corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 26: 56.8% (combination), 44.4% (infliximab), 30.0% (azathioprine)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Mucosal healing at week 26: 43.9% (combination), 30.1% (infliximab), 16.5% (azathioprine)
- Higher corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 50 for the combination therapy group compared to azathioprine alone
- Similar rates of adverse events among all treatment groups
