<h2><strong>Clinical Question</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
In patients undergoing PCI, are there significant differences between contemporary drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents in long-term outcomes?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Among patients undergoing PCI, no significant difference was found in 6-year rates of death and nonfatal spontaneous myocardial infarction between those receiving contemporary drug-eluting stents and those receiving bare-metal stents. However, repeat revascularization rates were lower with drug-eluting stents.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points</strong></h2><br/>
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
No specific guidelines discussed. Trial context suggests the use of either drug-eluting stents or bare-metal stents based on clinical judgment and patient preferences.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Multicenter, randomized trial comparing contemporary drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents in patients undergoing PCI for stable or unstable coronary artery disease.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population</strong></h2><br/>
Inclusion Criteria: Men and women at least 18 years of age with stable angina or acute coronary syndrome, suitable for stent implantation, able to communicate in Norwegian, and provided informed consent.<br/>
Exclusion Criteria: Prior coronary stent treatment, life expectancy less than 5 years from other medical conditions, participation in another trial, medication contraindication, or inability to follow protocol.<br/>
Baseline Characteristics: Groups were well balanced with minor differences in total stent length, lesion type, and lesions in coronary-artery bypass grafts.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
Placement of either drug-eluting stents (primarily everolimus-eluting or zotarolimus-eluting) or bare-metal stents during PCI. Aspirin and clopidogrel were prescribed post-procedure for all patients.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes</strong></h2><br/>
Primary Outcome: Composite of death from any cause and nonfatal spontaneous myocardial infarction showed no significant difference at a 6-year follow-up.<br/>
Secondary Outcomes: Any repeat revascularization was significantly lower in the drug-eluting stint group. Definite stent thrombosis rates were low and were potentially lower in the drug-eluting stint group.<br/>
Quality of life, assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, did not differ significantly between groups.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><br/>
<br/>
The Norwegian Research Council and several not-for-profit organizations, with no sponsor role in the design or conduct of the study.<br/>
