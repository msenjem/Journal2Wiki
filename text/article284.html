 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with recent stroke or TIA and without known coronary heart disease, does atorvastatin reduce the risk of subsequent strokes or cardiovascular events?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with recent stroke or TIA and without known coronary heart disease, daily treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin reduced the overall incidence of strokes and major cardiovascular events, despite a small increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Although statins are known to reduce the incidence of stroke in patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, their efficacy in preventing stroke after a recent stroke or TIA was not well established. SPARCL was therefore designed to investigate whether high-dose atorvastatin therapy could reduce the risk of subsequent stroke in this patient population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Since the publication of SPARCL, subsequent guidelines have recommended statin therapy for secondary prevention in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who have evidence of atherosclerosis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Age >18 years
- Stroke or TIA within one to six months of study entry
- LDL cholesterol levels 100-190 mg/dL
- No known coronary heart disease
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Atrial fibrillation, other cardiac sources of embolism, and subarachnoid hemorrhage
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics:
- Mean age: ~63 years
- 60% male
- Median LDL cholesterol: ~133 mg/dL
- Previous stroke: 66%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Atorvastatin 80 mg per day versus placebo
