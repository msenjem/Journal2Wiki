 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Rivaroxaban did not reduce the risk of recurrent stroke compared to aspirin in patients with recent embolic strokes of undetermined source and was associated with a higher risk of bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Embolic strokes of undetermined source account for approximately 20% of ischemic strokes. Anticoagulants may be more effective than antiplatelet therapy for preventing recurrent strokes in these patients. The NAVIGATE ESUS trial compared the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban with aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke or systemic embolism in patients with recent strokes of undetermined source.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Guidelines for secondary prevention of stroke in the context of embolic strokes of undetermined source would need to reflect the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Randomized, double-blind, event-driven, phase 3 trial at 459 centers in 31 countries.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with recent ischemic stroke of undetermined source without arterial stenosis, cardioembolic source, or other determined causes. 7213 participants were enrolled.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Ischemic stroke without a clear source
- Absence of proximal arterial stenosis, known cardioembolic source, or lacune
- Stroke occurrence between 7 days and 6 months prior to screening
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- History of atrial fibrillation
- Severe stroke (modified Rankin score â‰¥4)
- Indication for anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy beyond study parameters
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Rivaroxaban (15 mg daily)
- Aspirin (100 mg daily)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Efficacy Outcomes:
- Recurrence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism
- Rivaroxaban group: 172 patients (5.1% annualized rate)
- Aspirin group: 160 patients (4.8% annualized rate)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Major bleeding events
- Rivaroxaban group: 62 patients (1.8% annualized rate)
- Aspirin group: 23 patients (0.7% annualized rate)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial was stopped early due to the lack of benefit and increased bleeding risk with rivaroxaban.
- A majority of the included patients had minor residual deficits at trial entry (median NIHSS score of 1).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Bayer and Janssen Research and Development.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Full trial manuscript as published in The New England Journal of Medicine
