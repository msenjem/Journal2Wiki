    "Protocol-Based Care for Early Septic Shock".The New England Journal of Medicine. Published on March 18, 2014.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Clinical Question:</strong></h2><br/>
Does protocol-based resuscitation improve the outcomes for patients presenting to the emergency department with septic shock?<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></h2><br/>
In patients with septic shock identified in the emergency department, protocol-based resuscitation did not lead to better outcomes compared to usual care.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Major Points:</strong></h2><br/>
- Previous study by Rivers et al. in 2001 indicated that early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) lowered mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.<br/><br/>
- Findings showed no significant difference in 60-day in-hospital mortality between patients receiving protocol-based care and those receiving usual care.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Guidelines:</strong></h2><br/>
- At the time of study publication, there were no updated guidelines reflecting these trial results.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Design:</strong></h2><br/>
- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial<br/>
- N=1,341 adult patients with septic shock in emergency departments across the United States<br/>
- Interventions: Protocol-based EGDT (n=439), protocol-based standard therapy not requiring central venous catheterization or inotropes (n=446), and usual care (n=456)<br/>
- Primary endpoint: 60-day in-hospital mortality<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Population:</strong></h2><br/>
- Inclusion Criteria: Adults with suspected sepsis, two or more SIRS criteria, refractory hypotension, or serum lactate level â‰¥4 mmol/L<br/>
- Exclusion Criteria: Please refer to the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Interventions:</strong></h2><br/>
- Patients were randomized to receive 6 hours of resuscitation using one of three strategies:<br/>
1. Protocol-based EGDT, including central venous catheter to monitor pressure and ScvO2<br/>
2. Protocol-based standard therapy without requirements for central venous catheterization, inotropes, or blood transfusions<br/>
3. Usual care as determined by the treating physician<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Outcomes:</strong></h2><br/>
- 60-day in-hospital mortality: 21.0% (EGDT), 18.2% (standard therapy), and 18.9% (usual care); no significant difference<br/>
- No significant differences in secondary outcomes including 90-day mortality, 1-year mortality, or organ support requirements<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Criticisms:</strong></h2><br/>
- Though adherence to protocols was high, perfect adherence was not guaranteed.<br/>
- The positive effects of EGDT seen in earlier studies may not have translated into current practice due to advancements in sepsis care.<br/>
- The study cannot address whether early identification and intervention in septic shock would influence outcomes.<br/>
- The potential influence of varying practices regarding the withdrawal of care on in-hospital mortality<br/>
<br/>
<h2><strong>Funding:</strong></h2><br/>
- Funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.<br/>
