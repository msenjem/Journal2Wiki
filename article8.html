 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with acute myocardial infarction, accelerated t-PA combined with intravenous heparin provided a survival benefit over standard thrombolytic regimens with streptokinase.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The GUSTO trial compared four thrombolytic strategies in patients with evolving myocardial infarction and found that accelerated t-PA given with intravenous heparin reduces 30-day mortality more effectively than regimens using streptokinase.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines for management of myocardial infarction may reflect the findings of the GUSTO trial, recommending the use of accelerated t-PA with intravenous heparin based on patient-specific factors and balancing the benefits and risks.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial
- N=41,021
- Four treatment groups:
  1. Streptokinase with subcutaneous heparin
  2. Streptokinase with intravenous heparin
  3. Accelerated t-PA with intravenous heparin
  4. Combination streptokinase plus t-PA with intravenous heparin
- Setting: 1081 hospitals in 15 countries
- Enrollment: December 1990 to February 1993
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients with symptoms of myocardial infarction of less than 6 hours' duration with ST-segment elevation
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Streptokinase (1.5 million U) with either subcutaneous or intravenous heparin, or
- Accelerated t-PA with intravenous heparin, or
- Combined streptokinase plus t-PA with intravenous heparin
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: 30-day mortality
- Secondary: Combined endpoints of death and nonfatal stroke, death and nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke, and death and nonfatal disabling stroke
- Tertiary: Stroke and bleeding complications
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open-label design without a placebo group may introduce bias
- The cost and complexity of administering t-PA may limit its widespread use
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Supported by a combined grant from Bayer, CIBA-Corning, Genentech, ICI Pharmaceuticals, and Sanofi Pharmaceuticals
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The full article, as published in The New England Journal of Medicine, provides a detailed account of the study methods, populations, interventions, and outcomes. </span></p>
