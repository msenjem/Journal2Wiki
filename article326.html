 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), does long-term therapy with tiotropium improve clinical outcomes?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with COPD, therapy with tiotropium over a 4-year period improved lung function, quality of life, and exacerbations but did not significantly slow the rate of decline in FEV1.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Earlier studies suggested that tiotropium might slow the rate of decline in FEV1 in patients with COPD. The Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT) trial aimed to investigate whether tiotropium would reduce FEV1 decline over a 4-year period while allowing other respiratory medications except other inhaled anticholinergic drugs.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the time of the study, guidelines did not specifically recommend the use of tiotropium for altering disease progression, though it may be used for symptomatic relief.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial
- N=5,993 patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD
- Tiotropium (n=2,987) vs. Placebo (n=3,006)
- Setting: 490 investigational centers in 37 countries
- Enrollment: January 2003 to March 2004
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Follow-up: 4 years
- Primary outcome: Yearly rate of decline in mean FEV1 before and after bronchodilation from day 30 until completion of double-blind treatment
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Diagnosis of COPD
- Age ≥40 years
- Smoking history of ≥10 pack-years
- Postbronchodilator FEV1 ≤70% predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio ≤70% after bronchodilation
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Asthma history
- COPD exacerbation or respiratory infection within 4 weeks before screening
- History of pulmonary resection
- Use of supplemental oxygen >12 hours/day
- Coexisting illness impacting participation or results
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age: 65±8 years
- 75% male, 30% current smokers
- Mean postbronchodilator FEV1: 1.32±0.44 liters (48% predicted)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients received either 18 μg of tiotropium or matching placebo once daily delivered through the HandiHaler inhalation device
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- No significant differences between groups in the rate of decline in the mean FEV1 before or after bronchodilation from day 30 to the end of the study-drug treatment
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Tiotropium group maintained mean FEV1 and FVC improvements throughout the trial compared to placebo (P<0.001)
- SGRQ scores were better in the tiotropium group throughout the 4-year period (P<0.001)
- Delay in time to the first exacerbation and hospitalization for an exacerbation with tiotropium
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by Boehringer Ingelheim and Pfizer.
