 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In adults with less severe hypertension (systolic blood pressures <160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures of 80 to 95 mm Hg), does a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, with reduced saturated and total fat, lower blood pressure?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The DASH diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated and total fat, significantly reduces blood pressure, suggesting an effective dietary approach to prevent and treat hypertension.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The DASH trial was a multicenter, randomized feeding study assessing the impact of dietary patterns on blood pressure. Adults not on antihypertensive medication were provided various diets to determine the effects on blood pressure. The study found that the combination diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, with reduced saturated and total fat, substantially lowered blood pressure, offering an additional approach to hypertension prevention and treatment.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Not directly applicable; however, the DASH diet supports current recommendations for dietary modification in the management of hypertension.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled, feeding trial
- N=459 adults
- Three dietary groups: Control diet, Fruit and Vegetable diet, and Combination diet
- Intervention phase: 8 weeks
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adults aged 22 years or older, who were not on antihypertensive medication
- Baseline systolic blood pressures <160 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressures 80 to 95 mm Hg
- Demographically diverse population: approx. 49% women, 60% black
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Systolic blood pressures <160 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressures 80 to 95 mm Hg
- Not taking antihypertensive medication
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia
- Cardiovascular event within previous six months
- Body-mass index >35
- Alcohol consumption >14 drinks per week, among others
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Similar across the three diet groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Control diet: Typical of American diets
- Fruits and vegetables diet: Higher in fruits and vegetables than the control diet
- Combination diet: Rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and reduced in saturated and total fat
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Change in diastolic blood pressure at rest
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Change in systolic blood pressure and in ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Short duration of study; long-term adherence to the diet and effects on clinical cardiovascular events were not assessed.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Grants from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the Office of Research on Minority Health, and the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health.
