 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with PNH, eculizumab significantly stabilized hemoglobin levels, reduced transfusion requirements, improved markers of intravascular hemolysis, and improved quality of life.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">PNH is a disease characterized by intravascular hemolysis due to absent GPI-linked proteins leading to anemia and a need for frequent transfusions as well as other complications. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody against complement protein C5, inhibits terminal complement activation. The TRIUMPH trial demonstrated that eculizumab effectively stabilized hemoglobin levels without transfusions in 49% of treated patients, significantly reduced the median number of transfused red cell units, and reduced intravascular hemolysis compared to placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">There are no direct guidelines outlined within this study. However, based on evidence from this trial, eculizumab may be a recommended treatment option for patients with PNH requiring frequent transfusions.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 trial
- N=87 patients with PNH
- Eculizumab group (n=43) vs. Placebo group (n=44)
- Treatment period of 26 weeks
- Two primary endpoints: stabilization of hemoglobin levels without transfusion, number of units of packed red cells transfused
- Secondary endpoints included changes in lactate dehydrogenase levels and quality of life measures.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adults (≥18 years) with PNH with at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months.
- Inclusion: PNH type III erythrocyte proportion ≥ 10%, platelet count ≥100,000/mm3, lactate dehydrogenase ≥1.5 times the upper limit of normal.
- Exclusion: Recent investigational drug use, complement deficiency, active bacterial infection, or history of bone marrow transplantation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Eculizumab: 600 mg intravenously weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg at week 5 and then 900 mg biweekly through week 26.
- Placebo administered with the same schedule.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">#### Primary Outcomes
- Stabilization of hemoglobin levels without transfusion: 49% in eculizumab group vs. 0% in placebo (P<0.001).
- Units of packed red cells transfused: Median of 0 units in eculizumab group vs. 10 units in placebo (P<0.001).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Transfusion independence was achieved in 51% with eculizumab vs. 0% with placebo (P<0.001).
- 85.8% lower median area under the curve for lactate dehydrogenase in eculizumab group (P<0.001).
- FACIT-Fatigue instrument and EORTC QLQ-C30 scores improved significantly from baseline to week 26 compared to placebo (P<0.001).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Lack of long-term outcome data regarding eculizumab's effect on thrombosis incidence in PNH.
- Results may not be generalizable to PNH patients without a history of frequent transfusions.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by Alexion Pharmaceuticals.
- Several authors reported financial relationships with Alexion Pharmaceuticals.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Supplemental materials and full trial protocol available on study publication page.
- Additional research and long-term studies on the use of eculizumab in PNH. </span></p>
