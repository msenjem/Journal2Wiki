 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with a recent myocardial infarction, low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once daily) significantly reduced the occurrence of ischemic cardiovascular events compared with placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inflammatory processes are implicated in atherosclerosis and post-myocardial infarction complications. Colchicine is an oral antiinflammatory medication used for gout and pericarditis. The Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT) aimed to evaluate the effect of colchicine on cardiovascular outcomes and its long-term safety in patients who had recently had a myocardial infarction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, no specific guidelines reflect the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=4,745; 2,366 to colchicine, 2,379 to placebo
- Setting: 167 centers in 12 countries
- Enrollment: December 2015 - August 2018
- Follow-up: Median 22.6 months
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Composite of death from cardiovascular causes, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adult patients within 30 days post-myocardial infarction
- Completed planned percutaneous revascularization procedures
- Treated according to national guidelines including intensive statin use
- Exclusions: Severe heart failure, LVEF < 35%, stroke in previous 3 months, type 2 MI, recent or planned CABG, recent noncutaneous cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, nontransient creatine kinase elevation, hematologic or severe renal/hepatic disease, substance abuse, long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy, sensitivity to colchicine
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomly assigned to receive colchicine (0.5 mg once daily) or placebo
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary outcome occurred in 5.5% (colchicine) compared with 7.1% (placebo) (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.96; P=0.02)
- Stroke (HR 0.26; 95% CI 0.10-0.70)
- Urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary revascularization (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31-0.81)
- Diarrhea reported in 9.7% (colchicine) vs 8.9% (placebo) (P=0.35)
- Pneumonia as a serious adverse event in 0.9% (colchicine) vs 0.4% (placebo) (P=0.03)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial's follow-up duration was relatively short (~23 months), limiting assessment of long-term treatment with colchicine.
- Risks and benefits of prolonged colchicine therapy were not established.
- Results apply only to patients with recent myocardial infarction and may not generalize to other patient groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by the Government of Quebec, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, philanthropic foundations, with the funds administered by the Montreal Heart Institute.
