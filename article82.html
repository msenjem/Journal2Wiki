 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, the addition of extended-release niacin with laropiprant to statin-based LDL cholesterol–lowering therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of major vascular events but did increase the risk of serious adverse events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Extended-release niacin raises HDL cholesterol levels and lowers LDL cholesterol levels and is thought to have potential cardiovascular benefits. Laropiprant is used to reduce the niacin-induced side effect of flushing. The HPS2-THRIVE trial examined the effects of extended-release niacin with laropiprant in combination with statin therapy in adults with vascular disease. The trial found no significant reduction in the risk of major vascular events with niacin–laropiprant treatment. However, serious adverse events such as disturbances in diabetes control, infections, and bleeding were significantly more common with niacin–laropiprant.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last knowledge update, this trial's findings support recommendations against the routine use of niacin in combination with laropiprant for the purpose of reducing cardiovascular risk in patients already on statin therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
- N=25,673
- Extended-release niacin with laropiprant (n=12,838)
- Placebo (n=12,835)
- Median follow-up: 3.9 years
- Setting: 245 sites in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and China
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Adults aged 50 to 80 years with a history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or diabetes with symptomatic coronary disease. There were no specific lipid level criteria for entry.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Extended-release niacin (2 g daily) with laropiprant (40 mg daily) vs. placebo
- Prerandomization run-in phase with LDL cholesterol–lowering therapy using statins
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: First major vascular event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, death from coronary causes, stroke, or arterial revascularization).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- High discontinuation rate of the medication due to side effects, which could impact the evaluation of its efficacy.
- The study cannot determine the separate effects of niacin and laropiprant.
- The results might not be generalizable to niacin formulations not combined with laropiprant.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">This trial was funded by Merck, the U.K. Medical Research Council, the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research U.K., and a grant from the British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Oxford.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Analyses of subgroups and additional outcomes related to the HPS2-THRIVE study can be found in supplementary materials and other related publications. </span></p>
