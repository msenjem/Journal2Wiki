 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with limited small-cell lung cancer, does twice-daily thoracic radiotherapy improve survival compared with once-daily thoracic radiotherapy when both are combined with cisplatin and etoposide?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with limited small-cell lung cancer, twice-daily thoracic radiotherapy significantly improved survival compared with once-daily therapy when combined with cisplatin and etoposide, but increased the risk of grade 3 esophagitis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Twice-daily accelerated thoracic radiotherapy, when combined with cisplatin and etoposide, offers a survival advantage over once-daily radiotherapy in limited small-cell lung cancer, with a 10% higher 5-year survival rate. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N=417 patients with limited small-cell lung cancer
- Once-daily thoracic radiotherapy (n=206)
- Twice-daily thoracic radiotherapy (n=211)
- Setting: Multiple institutions
- Enrollment: May 1989 to July 1992
- Mean follow-up: Almost 8 years
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Overall survival
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Small-cell lung cancer clinically confined to one hemithorax (limited)
- Adequate organ function and performance status
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Pleural effusions visible on chest films, symptomatic cardiac disease, previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, prior cancer
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Median age: 63 years (once-daily), 61 years (twice-daily)
- Sex: 40% female
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Four cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin (60 mg/m² on day 1) and etoposide (120 mg/m² on days 1-3) every 21 days
- Thoracic radiotherapy 45 Gy total dose, delivered as
   - Once-daily (1.8 Gy per day) over five weeks
   - Twice-daily (1.5 Gy per treatment) over three weeks
- Prophylactic cranial irradiation offered to patients with complete response
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Median survival: 19 months for once-daily, 23 months for twice-daily
- 2-year survival rate: 41% for once-daily, 47% for twice-daily
- 5-year survival rate: 16% for once-daily, 26% for twice-daily
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Grade 3 esophagitis: 11% for once-daily, 27% for twice-daily
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Public Health Service grants from the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, and Department of Health and Human Services
