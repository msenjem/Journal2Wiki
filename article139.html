                                        </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does alirocumab improve LDL cholesterol levels in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events who are already receiving their maximum tolerated dose of statins?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, treatment with alirocumab significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels when added to statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. A post hoc analysis suggested a reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events with alirocumab.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Alirocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor, has previously shown promise in reducing LDL cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients. The ODYSSEY LONG TERM trial expands on earlier studies by assessing the safety and efficacy of alirocumab over a 78-week period in a larger population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Updated guidelines will need to reflect the results of this trial and other ongoing studies to provide recommendations on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors in the management of hypercholesterolemia in statin-treated patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial
- N=2341 patients at high risk for cardiovascular events
- Randomized in a 2:1 ratio to alirocumab (150 mg every 2 weeks) or placebo
- Trial duration: 78 weeks
- Enrollment: N/A
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary efficacy outcome: Percentage change in calculated LDL cholesterol level from baseline to week 24
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: High-risk patients with calculated LDL cholesterol levels ≥70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter), receiving maximum tolerated dose of statins, with or without other lipid-lowering therapy
- Exclusion Criteria: N/A
- Baseline Characteristics: Mean age 60 years, 37.8% women, 68.9% had a history of coronary heart disease, 17.7% had heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Alirocumab 150 mg or placebo administered as a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: At week 24, alirocumab group had a 62 percentage point reduction in LDL cholesterol from baseline, compared to 0.8% in the placebo group (P<0.001)
- Secondary: Consistent LDL reduction observed over 78 weeks
- Safety: Higher rates of injection-site reactions, myalgia, neurocognitive events, and ophthalmologic events with alirocumab
- Cardiac events: Post hoc analysis showed a lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular events in the alirocumab group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Short relative duration for a chronic treatment
- Post hoc nature of cardiovascular outcomes analysis
- Lack of long-term safety and efficacy data
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Full study details and results can be accessed at NEJM.org, with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01507831. </span></p>
