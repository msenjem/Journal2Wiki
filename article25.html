 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In intermediate-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, TAVR was found to be noninferior to surgical aortic-valve replacement regarding the primary endpoint of death or disabling stroke for up to 2 years.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) 2 trial evaluated TAVR as compared with surgical aortic-valve replacement in patients at intermediate risk of complications from surgery. TAVR demonstrated noninferiority in terms of mortality or disabling strokes at 2 years follow-up. The TAVR group experienced less acute kidney injury, severe bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation, but higher rates of major vascular complications and paravalvular leakage compared to the surgical group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease have yet to be updated to reflect the findings of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N=2,032 intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis
- TAVR (n=1,011) vs. surgical replacement (n=1,021)
- Setting: 57 centers in the United States and Canada
- Enrollment: December 2011 to November 2013
- Mean follow-up: 2 years
- Primary outcome: Death from any cause or disabling stroke at 2 years
- Funding: Edwards Lifesciences
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Severe aortic stenosis with cardiac symptoms, STS risk score of â‰¥4.0%, or other factors leading to intermediate surgical risk.
- Exclusion Criteria: Risk of death within 30 days after surgery less than 4%, severe comorbidities, or concomitant conditions not encompassed in the STS risk model.
- Baseline Characteristics: Mean STS score of 5.8% in both groups, similar in demographic and clinical characteristics.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- TAVR with the balloon-expandable SAPIEN XT heart-valve system.
- Surgical aortic-valve replacement.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: No significant difference in the primary endpoint of death or disabling stroke at 2 years.
- Secondary Outcomes (at 2 years): TAVR resulted in larger aortic-valve areas, lower rates of acute kidney injury, severe bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. Surgery resulted in fewer major vascular complications and less paravalvular aortic regurgitation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Withdrawal rate after randomization was high, notably in the surgery group.
- The SAPIEN XT valve used is already succeeded by the next-generation SAPIEN 3 valve system.
- Long-term durability of bioprosthetic transcatheter valves remains undetermined beyond the timeframe of the study.
- Subclinical valve-leaflet thrombosis was not systematically evaluated.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Edwards Lifesciences.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Details of the PARTNER 2 trial can be found in the New England Journal of Medicine, published on April 2, 2016, with supplemental content available online. </span></p>
