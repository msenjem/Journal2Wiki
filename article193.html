 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In adults with early signs of septic shock, EGDT including intravenous antibiotics and adequate fluid resuscitation does not lead to improved outcomes compared with usual resuscitation care.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT), which involves the aggressive management of septic patients guided by specific hemodynamic goals, was previously shown to improve mortality in a single-center trial. However, this ProMISe trial, as part of a trio of multicenter trials (alongside ProCESS and ARISE), found no mortality benefit to EGDT when compared with usual care in patients with sepsis who received early identification and management, including IV antibiotics and fluids.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, international guidelines recommend early recognition and management of sepsis with antibiotics and fluids, but the strict use of EGDT has been called into question based on the results of ProMISe and similar trials.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial
- N=1,260 patients with early septic shock
- Intervention: EGDT (n=630)
- Control: Usual resuscitation care (n=630)
- Setting: 56 hospitals in England
- Enrollment period: February 16, 2011, to July 24, 2014
- Primary outcome: All-cause mortality at 90 days
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Adults (≥18 years)
- Presentation within 6 hours after emergency department visit
- Infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, and hypotension or hyperlactatemia
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Criteria not mentioned in the provided abstract
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Similar in both groups
- Refractory hypotension criteria met in approximately 55% of patients in both groups
- Hyperlactatemia criteria met in 65.4% in EGDT and 63.7% in usual care
- Mean first ScvO2 was 70±12%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- EGDT group: 6-hour resuscitation protocol guided by central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, central venous oxygen saturation
- Usual care group: Treatment decisions made by the treating clinicians, no protocolized resuscitation
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: No significant difference in 90-day all-cause mortality (EGDT 29.5% vs. usual care 29.2%, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20, P=0.90)
- Increased treatment intensity in the EGDT group, including use of intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions
- No differences in health-related quality of life or rates of serious adverse events
- Costs were higher on average in the EGDT group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The intervention could not be blinded.
- Only one-third of eligible patients were enrolled.
- Mortality rates were lower than anticipated.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- ProCESS and ARISE trials, which also assessed EGDT in septic shock. </span></p>
