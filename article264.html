 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does daily oral FTC-TDF (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in men and transgender women who have sex with men?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among men and transgender women who have sex with men, daily oral FTC-TDF use resulted in a 44% reduction in HIV acquisition, and detectable blood levels were strongly correlated with the prophylactic effect.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Preexposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPrEx) trial showed that daily oral FTC-TDF use among men and transgender women who have sex with men correlated with a significant reduction in HIV acquisition. The regimen was more effective when blood levels of the drug were detectable, which highlights the importance of adherence.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of 2010, preexposure prophylaxis with FTC-TDF was not yet included in guidelines for HIV prevention, awaiting further evidence and regulatory approvals.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=2499 HIV-seronegative men or transgender women who have sex with men
- FTC-TDF group (n=1248)
- Placebo group (n=1251)
- Setting: 11 sites in six countries
- Enrollment: 2007-2009
- Follow-up: Median 1.2 years (maximum 2.8 years)
- Analysis: Modified intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: HIV acquisition
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Male sex at birth, age of 18 years or older, HIV-seronegative status, and evidence of high risk for acquisition of HIV infection
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Information not provided
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- All subjects were born male, although 1% reported their current gender identity as female
- Mean age ranged from 26.8 to 27.5 years; the FTC-TDF group was on average nine months older than the placebo group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Administration of daily oral FTC-TDF or placebo
- Subjects also received HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, condoms, and management of sexually transmitted infections
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome:
- 36 HIV acquisitions in the FTC-TDF group compared to 64 in the placebo group, representing a 44% reduction in HIV incidence (95% CI, 15 to 63; P=0.005)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Rates of serious adverse events similar in both groups (P=0.57)
- Nausea reported more frequently during the first 4 weeks in the FTC-TDF group (P<0.001)
- Similar rates of elevation in serum creatinine in both groups, though more creatinine elevations trended in the FTC-TDF group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The protective effect of FTC-TDF did not meet the initially hypothesized efficacy rate
- Drug-level detection was low among users, potentially impacting the study's conclusions about drug efficacy and adherence
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Study drugs were donated by Gilead Sciences
