 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">In patients with atrial fibrillation who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), does dual antithrombotic therapy with dabigatran reduce the risk of bleeding compared to triple therapy with warfarin?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Dual antithrombotic therapy with dabigatran plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) after PCI in patients with atrial fibrillation was associated with a lower risk of bleeding events compared to triple therapy with warfarin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin. Dual therapy with dabigatran was also noninferior to triple therapy with warfarin with respect to risk of thromboembolic events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Triple antithrombotic therapy, with warfarin, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin, is traditionally indicated post-PCI for patients with atrial fibrillation but is notably associated with a high bleeding risk. The RE-DUAL PCI trial tested whether dual therapy with dabigatran and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) could lower bleeding risk while maintaining noninferior efficacy in the prevention of thromboembolic events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Current guidelines now consider dual antithrombotic therapy as an option in this patient population (class IIb recommendation), supported by RE-DUAL PCI and other studies.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial.
- N=2,725 patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone PCI.
- Intervention groups:
  - Dual therapy: dabigatran (110 mg or 150 mg twice daily) + P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor).
  - Triple therapy: warfarin + a P2Y12 inhibitor + aspirin (stopped after 1 to 3 months).
- Mean follow-up of 14 months.
- Primary efficacy analysis: intention-to-treat.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Adults â‰¥18 years with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
- Successful PCI with a bare-metal or drug-eluting stent within the previous 120 hours.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Bioprosthetic or mechanical heart valves, severe renal insufficiency, major coexisting conditions.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Mean age: 70.8 years.
- Acute coronary syndrome indication for 50.5% of patients.
- Drug-eluting stents used in 82.6%.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Randomization to dual therapy with dabigatran or triple therapy with warfarin.
- Duration of aspirin component in triple therapy: 1 month for bare-metal stent, 3 months for drug-eluting stent.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Lower incidence of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding with dual therapy (both dabigatran doses) compared to triple therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- Dual therapy was noninferior to triple therapy regarding thromboembolic events, death, or unplanned revascularization.
- No significant difference in serious adverse events between the groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- The original protocol called for more patients than were enrolled, potentially limiting power to examine individual efficacy according to dabigatran dose.
- Noninferiority margin was based on previous atrial fibrillation studies for a dissimilar endpoint.
- Contributions of aspirin omission and oral anticoagulant type regarding outcome differences between dual and triple therapy could only be speculated.
