 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">LCZ696, compared to enalapril, reduced the risks of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been a mainstay in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan) combines an angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan) with a neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril). The PARADIGM-HF trial showed that LCZ696 was superior to enalapril in reducing the risk of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan) may be considered in place of ACE inhibitors to further reduce the risks of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">8,442 patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of ≤40%.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to LCZ696 (at a dose of 200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily), in addition to recommended therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, with the trial designed to detect a difference in rates of death from cardiovascular causes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- LCZ696 group saw a primary outcome event in 21.8% vs. 26.5% in the enalapril group (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.87; P<0.001).
- Death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 17.0% on LCZ696 vs. 19.8% on enalapril (HR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93; P<0.001).
- Hospitalization for heart failure was also 21% lower in the LCZ696 group (P<0.001).
- Improved symptoms and physical limitations associated with heart failure in the LCZ696 group (P=0.001).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">While LCZ696 had higher rates of hypotension and nonserious angioedema, it had lower rates of renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough compared to the enalapril group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by Novartis.
