 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does aspirin reduce the risk of serious vascular events in adults with diabetes who do not have evident cardiovascular disease?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Aspirin use in persons with diabetes without evident cardiovascular disease reduced the risk of serious vascular events but increased the risk of major bleeding events. The benefits were largely counterbalanced by the bleeding hazard.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The ASCEND trial assessed the efficacy and safety of aspirin in diabetes patients without cardiovascular disease. The study found a 12% reduction in serious vascular events with aspirin, but also a 29% increased risk for major bleeding events. The absolute benefits and risks were similar in magnitude, suggesting precise balance in this population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Guidelines reflecting the results of this trial are not specified in the provided text.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=15,480 adults with diabetes and no evident cardiovascular disease
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type not specified)
- No known cardiovascular disease
- Uncertainty surrounding benefit of antiplatelet therapy
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Indication or contraindication for aspirin use 
- Other significant conditions impacting adherence to 5-year regimen
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics:
- Well-balanced between both groups
- Aspirin use prior to screening present in 35.6% of participants
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomized to receive either 100 mg of aspirin once daily or matching placebo
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes:
- Serious vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack, death from vascular causes excluding intracranial hemorrhage): lower in aspirin group (8.5% vs 9.6% placebo)
- Major bleeding events (intracranial hemorrhage, eye bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other serious bleeding): higher in aspirin group (4.1% vs 3.2% placebo)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Secondary Outcome:
- Gastrointestinal tract cancer incidence: no significant difference between the aspirin and placebo groups
- Other cancers (fatal or nonfatal): no significant difference between groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The provided text does not articulate specific criticisms of the trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by the British Heart Foundation, Bayer (Germany and the United States), Solvay, Abbott, and Mylan. Trial drugs and matching placebo were provided by Bayer.
