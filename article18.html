 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with left ventricular dysfunction but not overt heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI), does treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril reduce morbidity and mortality?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with left ventricular dysfunction after MI, long-term administration of captopril was associated with improved survival, reduced cardiovascular mortality, fewer major cardiovascular events, and attenuated ventricular remodeling.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients who survive an MI yet have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction without overt heart failure remain at increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The SAVE trial was designed to assess if treating this population with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril could improve outcomes.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">The study randomized 2231 patients to either captopril or placebo. Patients had an ejection fraction (EF) ≤40% and were within 3 to 16 days post-MI, without symptoms of ongoing ischemia or manifest heart failure. The results over the mean 42-month follow-up showed a 19% reduction in all-cause mortality and significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the captopril group compared to placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors in patients with systolic dysfunction, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, following MI to improve survival.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial
- N=2,231
    - Captopril: 1,115
    - Placebo: 1,116
- Setting: 112 hospitals in the United States and Canada
- Enrollment: January 1987 - January 1990
- Follow-up: Average of 42 months
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: All-cause mortality
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Survived the first 3 days post-MI
- Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%
- Age ≥21 and <80
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Contraindication to ACE inhibitor use
- Need for an ACE inhibitor for other indications (heart failure, hypertension)
- Serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL
- Unstable post-MI course
- Inability to consent or comply with follow-up
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- No significant differences between groups at baseline.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Captopril: Initial dose of 12.5 mg (or 6.25 mg in select cases) with a target of 25 mg three times daily by end of hospital phase, and up to 50 mg three times daily as tolerated.
- Placebo: Administered following the same schedule as captopril.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- 19% reduction in all-cause mortality (captopril group 20% vs. placebo group 25%; P=0.019)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- 21% reduction in cardiovascular mortality (P=0.014)
- 37% reduction in development of severe heart failure (P<0.001)
- 22% reduction in congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization (P=0.019)
- 25% reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction (P=0.015)
- Less deterioration in ejection fraction (captopril group 13% vs. placebo group 16%; P=0.168)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The potential impact of newer treatments and strategies for MI developed after the study period is not assessed.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was supported by a grant from the Bristol-Myers Squibb Institute for Pharmaceutical Research, which had no role in data management or unblinded information access.
