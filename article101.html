 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In acutely ill medical patients, extended thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban after hospital discharge did not significantly reduce the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism when compared with placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Acutely ill medical patients are at risk for venous thromboembolism following discharge from the hospital, but the benefit of extended thromboprophylaxis remains uncertain due to concerns about bleeding risk. The MARINER trial sought to determine the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for 45 days post-discharge in preventing symptomatic venous thromboembolism in this population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, guidelines had not yet been established reflecting the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">MARINER was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial involving medically ill patients at increased risk for venous thromboembolism.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Patients aged ≥40 years hospitalized for ≥3 to ≤10 days with acute medical illnesses and additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism
- Exclusion Criteria: Patients with conditions requiring long-term anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet therapy, active cancer, recent significant bleeding, or other contraindications to rivaroxaban
- Baseline Characteristics: Similar across intervention and placebo groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized at hospital discharge to receive either rivaroxaban (10 mg daily or 7.5 mg daily for those with moderate renal impairment) or placebo for 45 days.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism
- Principal Safety Outcome: Major bleeding
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The low incidence of venous thromboembolism–related events in the placebo group (1.10%) and the inclusion of sudden death of unknown cause may have affected the specificity of venous thromboembolism–related death as an outcome.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">This trial was funded by Janssen Research and Development.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Additional details and comprehensive data analysis are available in the full text of the article in The New England Journal of Medicine. </span></p>
