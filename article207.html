 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Pentoxifylline did not improve survival rates in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Prednisolone was associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality that did not reach significance and with no improvement in outcomes at 90 days or 1 year.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The STOPAH trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design to evaluate the treatment effects of prednisolone and pentoxifylline on severe alcoholic hepatitis, a condition with high short-term mortality rates. The study found that pentoxifylline did not demonstrate improvements in patient survival. Prednisolone, while associated with a non-significant reduction in 28-day mortality, showed no significant improvement in mortality at 90 days or 1 year. Prednisolone treatment was linked to an increased risk of serious infections.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not reflect the outcome of the STOPAH trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design evaluating pentoxifylline and prednisolone as treatments.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- 1,103 patients were enrolled initially, with 1,053 available for the final analysis.
- Inclusion criteria:
  - Age ≥18 years
  - Clinical diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis
  - Severe disease (discriminant function ≥32 or bilirubin >80 μmol/L)
  - History of heavy and prolonged alcohol use
- Exclusion criteria:
  - Jaundice for more than 3 months
  - Cessation of alcohol consumption for more than 2 months prior to randomization 
  - Other causes of liver disease present
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized into four groups:
  - Placebo for both pentoxifylline and prednisolone
  - Prednisolone alone
  - Pentoxifylline alone
  - Both prednisolone and pentoxifylline
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome:
- Mortality at 28 days:
  - Placebo–placebo: 17%
  - Prednisolone–placebo: 14%
  - Pentoxifylline–placebo: 19%
  - Prednisolone–pentoxifylline: 13%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Death or liver transplantation at 90 days and at 1 year, with no significant differences observed between groups.
- Serious infections occurred in 13% of prednisolone patients versus 7% who did not receive prednisolone (P=0.002).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The accuracy of diagnosing alcoholic hepatitis without liver biopsy could be questioned, potentially impacting the power of the study to detect a treatment effect. The study was stopped early due to funding limitations, limiting the follow-up data available for some participants.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment program.
