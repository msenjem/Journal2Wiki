 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does canakinumab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β, lead to a lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with a previous myocardial infarction and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2 mg or more per liter?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Canakinumab at a dose of 150 mg every 3 months led to a significantly lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events compared to placebo, independent of lipid-level lowering.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The CANTOS trial was designed to test the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis by evaluating the efficacy of canakinumab, an interleukin-1β blocker, in reducing recurrent cardiovascular events post-myocardial infarction in patients with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, no guidelines have been updated to reflect the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=10,061
- Intervention: Three doses of canakinumab (50 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg injected subcutaneously every 3 months) versus placebo
- Setting: 27 centers
- Enrollment: April 2011 to March 2014
- Mean follow-up: 3.7 years
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: A composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Patients with a history of myocardial infarction and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels ≥2 mg per liter
- Exclusion Criteria: Chronic or recurrent infection, history of cancer except basal-cell skin carcinoma, immunocompromised state, high risk of tuberculosis, or on other systemic anti-inflammatory treatments
- Baseline Characteristics: Mean age 61 years, 25.7% female, 40.0% with diabetes
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Canakinumab: 50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg subcutaneous injection every 3 months
- Placebo: Subcutaneous injection every 3 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: The 150-mg dose showed a significant reduction in the rate of the primary efficacy endpoint compared to placebo, with hazard ratios of 0.85 (P=0.021) for the primary endpoint and 0.83 (P=0.005) for the key secondary cardiovascular endpoint that additionally included hospitalization for unstable angina leading to urgent revascularization.
- Secondary Outcomes: Canakinumab was associated with a higher incidence of fatal infections compared to placebo and did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality. There was no significant increase in the risk of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or hemorrhage. The cancer mortality rate was significantly lower among those receiving canakinumab.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial showed a higher incidence of fatal infections with canakinumab use.
- There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality, and only the 150 mg dose met the significance threshold for the primary endpoint.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by Novartis.
