 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In routine PCI, there was no significant difference in the rate of target-vessel failure between patients who received a bioresorbable scaffold and those who received a metallic stent. However, the bioresorbable scaffold was associated with a higher incidence of device thrombosis than the metallic stent through 2 years of follow-up.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) were developed as an alternative to drug-eluting stents (DES) in PCI to address limitations such as hampering vasomotion and increased risk of neoatherosclerosis. The AIDA trial compared an everolimus-eluting bioresorbable scaffold with an everolimus-eluting metallic stent in routine PCI practices. Over a median follow-up of 707 days, target-vessel failure was comparable between the two, but the bioresorbable scaffold group experienced significantly higher rates of device thrombosis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">No guideline recommendations are provided in the article due to the presentation of preliminary results.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Investigator-initiated, randomized, single-blind, multicenter, noninferiority trial.
- N=1845 patients undergoing PCI.
- Interventions: bioresorbable vascular scaffold (n=924) versus metallic stent (n=921).
- Median follow-up period: 707 days.
- Primary endpoint: target-vessel failure (composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI.
- Exclusion Criteria: Target lesions >70 mm in length, reference vessel diameter <2.5 mm or >4 mm, planned bifurcation lesions requiring two stents, in-stent restenosis.
- Baseline Characteristics: Well-balanced demographics with a significant portion of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (54%).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomly assigned to receive either an everolimus-eluting BVS or an everolimus-eluting metallic stent
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Target-vessel failure occurred in 11.7% of the scaffold group and 10.7% of the stent group (HR 1.12; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.48; P=0.43).
- Secondary Outcome: Cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization rates did not differ significantly between groups.
- Additional Analyses: Definite or probable device thrombosis was recorded in 3.5% of the scaffold group versus 0.9% of the stent group (HR 3.87; 95% CI, 1.78 to 8.42; P<0.001).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The occurrence of higher device thrombosis despite comparable rates of target-vessel failure raises questions regarding the advantages of BVS over DES. Additionally, the study did not perform routine intravascular imaging, limiting the understanding of device thrombosis mechanisms.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Abbott Vascular.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">More long-term follow-up data from this trial and ongoing research involving the next-generation BVS with modified features will be crucial to determine the potential benefits and identify strategies to mitigate device thrombosis risk. </span></p>
