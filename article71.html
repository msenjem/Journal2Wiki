 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">FFR-guided complete revascularization during primary PCI for STEMI was associated with reduced risk of composite primary outcome at 12 months, driven predominantly by lower rates of repeat revascularization compared to a strategy of treating the infarct-related artery alone.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Compare-Acute trial found benefits in the composite primary outcome with FFR-guided complete revascularization in STEMI patients, but this was mainly due to a reduction in repeat revascularization. When considering revascularizations during the index admission, the difference in total revascularizations between complete-revascularization and infarct-artery-only groups was significant. The trial was not powered to assess single hard end points like myocardial infarction and death.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines on the specific use of FFR-guided PCI in STEMI patients during primary PCI for non–infarct-related arteries remain to be updated to reflect results from trials like Compare-Acute.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Perspective by Drs. Bibas and Thanassoulis questioning interpretation of Compare-Acute trial results.
- Response by Drs. Smits and Boxma-de Klerk defending their trial's conclusions and methodology.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients with STEMI undergoing PCI
- Not specified in the letters: Full trial inclusion/exclusion criteria from the original Compare-Acute study
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Complete revascularization with FFR-guided PCI of non–infarct-related coronary arteries 
- Infarct-related artery treatment only
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Bibas and Thanassoulis: Challenge the interpretation of reduced repeat revascularizations.
- Ferrante and Stefanini: Point out potential for operator bias and misclassification of events in the infarct-artery-only group.
- Authors Smits and Boxma-de Klerk: Defend results, highlighting post hoc analyses that continue to show reduced MACCE with the complete-revascularization strategy despite potential operator bias.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Drs. Bibas and Thanassoulis argued that the study could be interpreted differently, suggesting more total revascularizations in complete-revascularization group when including index admission procedures, advocating for trials powered to assess hard clinical outcomes excluding revascularization.
- Drs. Ferrante and Stefanini suggested a risk of misclassification of events, potentially leading to a falsely optimistic view of treatment effects.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Not specified in the letters. The original Compare-Acute trial funding should be referred to for more details.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Original Compare-Acute trial publication and supplementary materials.
- Further trials evaluating the role of FFR-guided complete revascularization in STEMI patients.
