 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Intensive glucose control in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes did not significantly reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events, death, or microvascular complications, except for a reduction in the progression of albuminuria.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The effects of intensive glucose control on cardiovascular events in veteran patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and a high cardiovascular risk profile were investigated in the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT). The results did not show a significant reduction in the composite of cardiovascular events with intensive therapy compared to standard therapy over a median follow-up of 5.6 years.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last knowledge update for this summary, no specific guidelines have been generated based on this trial. However, guidelines generally suggest individualized glucose targets for patients with type 2 diabetes, taking into account the risk of hypoglycemia, patient preference, and disease duration.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial
- N=1791 military veterans with type 2 diabetes and suboptimal response to therapy
- Intensive therapy (n=891); Standard therapy (n=900)
- Setting: 20 VA medical centers in the U.S.
- Enrollment: 2000-2003
- Follow-up: median 5.6 years
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Time to the first major cardiovascular event
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion criteria: Military veterans with type 2 diabetes and suboptimal response to therapy, glycated hemoglobin level >7.5%
- Exclusion criteria: Recent cardiovascular event, advanced heart failure, limited life expectancy, BMI >40, creatinine >1.6 mg/dL, and alanine aminotransferase >3Ã— upper limit of normal
- Baseline characteristics: Mean age 60.4 years, 11.5 years since diabetes diagnosis, 40% had a cardiovascular event, 72% had hypertension
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Intensive therapy group: Goal glycated hemoglobin level reduction of 1.5% compared to the standard-therapy group
- Standard therapy group: Less aggressive glycemic targets
- Similar treatment for other cardiovascular risk factors
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: No significant difference in the time to the first occurrence of a major cardiovascular event between groups (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; P=0.14)
- Secondary Outcomes: No significant difference in any of the individual components of the primary outcome or in all-cause death (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.42; P=0.62)
- Adverse Events: Higher rate of hypoglycemia in the intensive-therapy group (24.1%) compared to standard-therapy group (17.6%, P=0.05)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primarily male veteran population may limit generalizability to other groups
- Lack of double-blind design may have introduced bias
- Potential for newer agents to have different effects not considered in the trial protocol
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program, Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development, pharmaceutical and other supplies and financial assistance from GlaxoSmithKline, Novo Nordisk, Roche Diagnostics, Sanofi-Aventis, Amylin, and Kos Pharmaceuticals.
