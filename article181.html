 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In critically ill patients with fever and suspected infection, does acetaminophen affect the number of ICU-free days?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In critically ill patients with fever and suspected infection, early administration of acetaminophen did not affect the number of ICU-free days compared to placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Fever in ICU patients with infections is commonly treated with acetaminophen, although its utility and impacts on patient outcomes are unclear. In a randomized controlled trial, acetaminophen did not increase ICU-free days and had no significant effect on mortality or other secondary outcomes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not provide specific recommendations regarding the use of acetaminophen in this context.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial
- N=700
- Acetaminophen (n=352) vs. Placebo (n=348)
- Setting: 23 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand
- Enrollment: February 2013 to July 2014
- Follow-Up: 90 days
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: number of ICU-free days to day 28
- Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN12612000513819
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age ≥16 years with body temperature ≥38°C
- Known or suspected infection with antimicrobial therapy
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Acute brain diseases
- Liver dysfunction contraindicating acetaminophen use
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between groups.
- Most common infection sites were lungs and abdomen.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Intravenous acetaminophen 1g or placebo every 6 hours
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- ICU-free days to day 28: 23 days (acetaminophen) vs. 22 days (placebo); P=0.07
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- 28-day mortality: 15.9% (acetaminophen) vs. 16.6% (placebo); P=0.84
- 90-day mortality: Same as 28-day mortality 
- Hospital length of stay and survival time to day 90: No significant difference
