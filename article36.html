 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">For patients with atrial fibrillation who require a temporary interruption of warfarin for an elective procedure, a strategy of forgoing bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for preventing arterial thromboembolism and reduced the risk of major bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">The question of using bridging anticoagulation during perioperative interruption of warfarin treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation was uncertain. The BRIDGE trial demonstrated that discontinuing warfarin without bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to bridging for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and offered a superior safety profile with significantly fewer instances of major bleeding.

- N=1,884
- No-bridging group (placebo) (n=950)

- Setting: 108 centers in the United States and Canada
- Enrollment: 2009-2014
- Mean follow-up: 30 days after the procedure
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcomes: Arterial thromboembolism and major bleeding within 30 days after the procedure

 </span></p><p><span class="main">- Mean age: 71.7 years
- Male: 73.4%
- Mean body weight: 95.8 kg

- Randomization to placebo (no-bridging) or bridging treatment with dalteparin (100 IU/kg subcutaneously twice daily) starting 3 days before the procedure until 24 hours before the procedure and then for 5 to 10 days after the procedure
- Resumption of warfarin within 24 hours after the procedure

- Major bleeding: 1.3% in the no-bridging group vs. 3.2% in the bridging group (relative risk, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.78; P=0.005 for superiority)

 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">- The trial did not include patients with mechanical heart valves, and few patients had high CHADS2 scores.
- The trial did not include procedures with high rates of arterial thromboembolism and bleeding, such as major surgery.
- The observed rate of arterial thromboembolism was lower than expected, potentially affecting the power to detect a clear benefit of bridging.
- The trial was conducted during the period where the use of warfarin is being overtaken by newer direct oral anticoagulants.
