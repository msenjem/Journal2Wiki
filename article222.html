 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were at moderate-to-high risk for death, a restrictive red-cell transfusion strategy was noninferior to a liberal strategy, resulting in fewer transfusions without increasing the risk of composite outcomes including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Cardiac surgery patients have been among the highest recipients of red-cell transfusion. There has been uncertainty regarding the safety of restrictive transfusion strategies in cardiac surgery due to potential anemia-induced tissue hypoxia in already high-risk patients. The Transfusion Requirements in Cardiac Surgery (TRICS) III trial showed that in adults undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, a restrictive transfusion therapy (transfusion if hemoglobin <7.5 g/dL) was noninferior to a liberal strategy (transfusion if hemoglobin <9.5 g/dL in OR/ICU or <8.5 g/dL in a non-ICU ward).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cut-off date, no specific updated guidelines have been released that reflect the results of this trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">5,243 adults (age ≥18 years) undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass who had a EuroSCORE I of 6 or more.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Scheduled for cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass
- Predicted preoperative risk of death with EuroSCORE I ≥6
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Unable to receive blood products
- Declined blood products
- Involved in preoperative autologous donation
- Undergoing heart transplantation or ventricular assist device insertion
- Pregnant or lactating
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Mean age: 72±10 years
- 35.4% females
- Mean EuroSCORE I: 7.8±1.9
- Type of surgery: CABG only (26.1%), CABG plus another procedure (27.7%), non-CABG procedure (46.2%)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomized to restrictive (n=2,430) or liberal (n=2,430) red-cell transfusion strategies, from anesthesia induction to hospital discharge or day 28 post-surgery.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis by hospital discharge or by day 28 (whichever came first).
- Occurred in 11.4% of restrictive group vs. 12.5% of liberal group (odds ratio, 0.90; p<0.001 for noninferiority).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Red-cell transfusion occurred in 52.3% of restrictive group vs. 72.6% of liberal group (odds ratio, 0.41, p<0.001).
- No significant differences in other secondary outcomes between groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Non-blinded design may introduce bias in outcome reporting.
- The restrictive group achieved a hemoglobin concentration on average 1 g/dL less than the liberal group during the study, which was less than the difference in transfusion triggers.
- Excluded low-risk patients, and did not test efficacy of transfusion or whether lower transfusion thresholds might be safe.
- Did not include patients with acute coronary artery disease.
