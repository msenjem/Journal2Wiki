 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Antidepressant discontinuation in primary care patients who felt ready to stop increased the risk of depression relapse compared to maintenance therapy over 52 weeks. Quality of life, and symptoms of depression and anxiety, were worse in patients who discontinued their antidepressant therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Recent increases in antidepressant prescriptions are largely due to extended treatment durations. Data regarding the effects of maintaining versus discontinuing long-term antidepressant therapy in primary care patients are limited. The Antidepressants to Prevent Relapse in Depression (ANTLER) trial found that discontinuing antidepressants increased the risk of relapse compared to ongoing therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">This trial contributes to discussions on guidelines for managing long-term antidepressant therapy in primary care, specifically the potential risks of discontinuation in patients who feel well enough to consider stopping the medication.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomized, double-blind trial
- N=478 (238 in maintenance group, 240 in discontinuation group)
- Setting: 150 general practices in the United Kingdom
- Follow-up: 52 weeks
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: First relapse of depression by 52 weeks
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adult patients in primary care practices
- History of at least two depressive episodes or taking antidepressants for 2 years or longer
- Felt well enough to consider stopping antidepressants
- Most commonly prescribed antidepressants: citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Maintenance group continued current antidepressant therapy
- Discontinuation group tapered and discontinued therapy with placebo replacement
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Relapse occurred in 39% of maintenance group vs. 56% of discontinuation group (HR 2.06; P<0.001)
- Secondary outcomes generally favored the maintenance group; patients in the discontinuation group had more depressive, anxiety, and withdrawal symptoms
- 39% of patients in the discontinuation group returned to prescribed antidepressant use by end of the trial
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Not generalizable to all antidepressants as only specific types were included
- Excluded patients on doses different from standard U.K. maintenance doses
- Limited patient participation rate
- Findings applicable only to patients ready to cease medication
- Method used to define depression relapse adapted for the study, which may not be generalized
- Lack of diversity among trial participants
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- National Institute for Health Research
