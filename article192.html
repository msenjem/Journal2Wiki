 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with septic shock identified in the emergency department, protocol-based resuscitation did not lead to better outcomes compared to usual care.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Previous study by Rivers et al. in 2001 indicated that early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) lowered mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.
- The ProCESS trial aimed to determine the generalizability of these findings and if all elements of the EGDT protocol were necessary.
- Findings showed no significant difference in 60-day in-hospital mortality between patients receiving protocol-based care and those receiving usual care.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- At the time of study publication, there were no updated guidelines reflecting these trial results.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N=1,341 adult patients with septic shock in emergency departments across the United States
- Interventions: Protocol-based EGDT (n=439), protocol-based standard therapy not requiring central venous catheterization or inotropes (n=446), and usual care (n=456)
- Primary endpoint: 60-day in-hospital mortality
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Adults with suspected sepsis, two or more SIRS criteria, refractory hypotension, or serum lactate level â‰¥4 mmol/L
- Exclusion Criteria: Please refer to the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients were randomized to receive 6 hours of resuscitation using one of three strategies:
1. Protocol-based EGDT, including central venous catheter to monitor pressure and ScvO2
2. Protocol-based standard therapy without requirements for central venous catheterization, inotropes, or blood transfusions
3. Usual care as determined by the treating physician
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- 60-day in-hospital mortality: 21.0% (EGDT), 18.2% (standard therapy), and 18.9% (usual care); no significant difference
- No significant differences in secondary outcomes including 90-day mortality, 1-year mortality, or organ support requirements
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Though adherence to protocols was high, perfect adherence was not guaranteed.
- The positive effects of EGDT seen in earlier studies may not have translated into current practice due to advancements in sepsis care.
- The study cannot address whether early identification and intervention in septic shock would influence outcomes.
- The potential influence of varying practices regarding the withdrawal of care on in-hospital mortality
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The full text of this article is available at NEJM.org.
