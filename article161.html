 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Catheter ablation was more effective than escalated antiarrhythmic drug therapy in reducing the composite outcome of death, ventricular tachycardia storm, or appropriate ICD shock among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who have ventricular tachycardia despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation versus Escalated Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy in Ischemic Heart Disease (VANISH) trial concluded that for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and recurrent ventricular tachycardia despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy, catheter ablation reduces the rate of a composite outcome of death, ventricular tachycardia storm, or appropriate ICD shock compared to escalated antiarrhythmic drug therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines recommend catheter ablation when antiarrhythmic drug therapy does not prevent recurrent ventricular tachycardia, although this recommendation has been based on expert opinion and nonrandomized case series. This trial provides evidence for preferring catheter ablation over escalated antiarrhythmic drug therapy to reduce recurrent ventricular tachycardia in this population.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">259 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ICD with ventricular tachycardia despite antiarrhythmic drugs.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to either catheter ablation (n=132) or escalated antiarrhythmic drug therapy (n=127).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Composite outcome of death at any time, ventricular tachycardia storm, or appropriate ICD shock.
Primary outcome occurred in 59.1% of the ablation group vs. 68.5% of the escalated-therapy group (HR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.98; P=0.04). No significant differences in mortality.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was not powered to assess the effects of treatments on mortality and was conducted at experienced centers, limiting generalizability.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Canadian Institutes of Health Research with additional financial support from St. Jude Medical and Biosense Webster.
