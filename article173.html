 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with septic shock, using a lower hemoglobin threshold (≤7 g per deciliter) for red cell transfusion compared with a higher threshold (≤9 g per deciliter) resulted in fewer transfusions without a significant difference in 90-day mortality, ischemic events, use of life support, or days alive out of the hospital.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The TRISS trial was a multicenter, randomized study evaluating the impact of different hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion in patients with septic shock on 90-day mortality. One group received blood transfusions at a hemoglobin level ≤7 g/dL (the lower threshold), while the other group received them at ≤9 g/dL (the higher threshold). The study found no significant difference in mortality at 90 days, ischemic events, severe adverse reactions, or life support use between the two groups, with the lower-threshold group receiving 50% fewer transfusions.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The current guidelines for transfusion in septic shock patients recommend maintaining a hemoglobin concentration above 7 g/dL unless the patient exhibits symptoms such as myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, or ongoing hemorrhage.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, stratified, parallel-group, randomized, partially blinded clinical trial
N=998 adult patients with septic shock
Interventions:
- Lower-threshold group (≤7 g per deciliter) for transfusion (n=502)
- Higher-threshold group (≤9 g per deciliter) for transfusion (n=496)
Primary outcome: Death at 90 days post-randomization
Secondary outcomes: Ischemic events, life support use, adverse reactions to transfusion, percentage of days alive without life support, and days alive out of the hospital within 90 days
Enrollment: December 2011 to December 2013
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Adult patients (≥18 years) in the ICU
- Septic shock diagnosis according to criteria
- Hemoglobin concentration ≤9 g/dL
Exclusion Criteria:
- Significant bleeding
- Requirement for ECMO
- Not specified acute myocardial infarction
Baseline Characteristics:
- Similar between both groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Red cell transfusions at hemoglobin ≤7 g/dL for the lower-threshold group
- Transfusions at hemoglobin ≤9 g/dL for the higher-threshold group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes:
- At 90 days, mortality was 43.0% in the lower-threshold group versus 45.0% in the higher-threshold group (relative risk, 0.94; P=0.44)
Secondary Outcomes:
- Similar use of life support at days 5, 14, and 28
- Comparable numbers of ischemic events and severe adverse reactions
- No significant difference in the percentages of days alive without life support or out of the hospital
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Lack of blinding for investigators, clinicians, and patients regarding transfusion thresholds could introduce bias.
- Limited power to detect significant differences in secondary outcomes and certain subgroup analyses.
- The choice to use leukoreduced blood, potentially limiting the applicability concerning nonleukoreduced blood.
- Trial did not specify surveillance for myocardial ischemia, possibly missing some events and resulting in detection bias.
