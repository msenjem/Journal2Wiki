 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prophylactic ICD implantation in patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure not caused by coronary artery disease did not significantly lower the long-term rate of death from any cause when compared to usual clinical care, although it halved the risk of sudden cardiac death.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">ICD implantation is known to reduce mortality in patients with systolic heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. In patients with nonischemic heart failure, evidence is limited, with benefits primarily demonstrated in subgroup analyses. Additionally, heart failure management, including the use of CRT, has improved, which may influence outcomes. The DANISH trial (NCT00542945) investigated the role of ICDs in reducing mortality for patients with symptomatic nonischemic systolic heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time of the study, guidelines suggested class 1 recommendations for ICD implantation in patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure, with stronger evidence for ischemic versus nonischemic causes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N = 1,116 patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure not due to coronary artery disease
- Randomized to ICD (n = 556) vs usual clinical care (n = 560)
- Median follow-up: 67.6 months
- Trial conducted in Denmark
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion criteria: Patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure (LVEF ≤ 35%), not due to coronary artery disease, and NT-proBNP > 200 pg/mL
- Exclusion criteria: Permanent atrial fibrillation with resting heart rate > 100 bpm, renal failure requiring dialysis
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- ICD group (n = 556)
- Usual clinical care (control) group (n = 560)
- 58% of patients received CRT in both groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The primary outcome was death from any cause.
- Secondary outcomes were sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular death.
- Sudden cardiac death occurred less frequently in the ICD group (4.3% vs 8.2%, HR 0.50; P=0.005).
- No significant difference in all-cause mortality (HR 0.87; P=0.28)
- Device infection occurred in 4.9% of ICD group and 3.6% of control group (P=0.29).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Unblinded design.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Funded by Medtronic, St. Jude Medical, TrygFonden, and the Danish Heart Foundation.
