 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Oral apixaban was noninferior to subcutaneous dalteparin in treating cancer-associated venous thromboembolism without an increased risk of major bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with cancer are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the treatment with anticoagulants is complex due to a higher risk of both recurrent VTE and bleeding. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) like edoxaban, and rivaroxaban have recently been integrated into treatment recommendations, although concerns about bleeding risks persist. In the Caravaggio trial, apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, was shown to be noninferior to dalteparin for preventing VTE recurrence in patients with cancer, without increasing the risk of major bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Recent guidelines recommend considering the DOACs edoxaban or rivaroxaban for treating VTE in patients with cancer, taking into account the potential increased risk of bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multinational, randomized, investigator-initiated, open-label, noninferiority trial with blinded central outcome adjudication.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Adults with cancer diagnosed with a symptomatic or incidental acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria: Patients with primary brain tumors, intracerebral metastases, acute leukemia, or other significant bleeding risks.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics: Similar across treatment groups, predominantly advanced active cancer and acute symptomatic VTE.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were assigned to oral apixaban (10 mg BID for 7 days, then 5 mg BID) or subcutaneous dalteparin (200 IU/kg daily for 1 month, then 150 IU/kg daily) for 6 months.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes: Objectively confirmed recurrent VTE.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Secondary Outcome: Major bleeding events and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Additional Analyses: Subgroup analyses by age and cancer type, and sensitivity analyses for protocol adherence and per-protocol population.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Adverse Events: Progression of cancer was the most common adverse event. Other adverse events were consistent with previous studies.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was open-label and excluded patients with brain tumors, cerebral metastases, or acute leukemia. The sample size was calculated for the primary outcome and not powered to definitively assess bleeding risk.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Bristol-Myers Squibbâ€“Pfizer Alliance provided an unrestricted grant for the study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">A complete list of the investigators in the Caravaggio trial is provided in the Supplementary Appendix of the original publication. </span></p>
