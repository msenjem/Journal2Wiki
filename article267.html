 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early treatment with dexamethasone improves the outcome in adults with acute bacterial meningitis and does not increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Studies in animals suggest that inflammation from bacterial lysis, induced by antibiotic treatment for bacterial meningitis, may contribute to an unfavorable outcome. Trials in children with meningitis showed mixed effects of dexamethasone, but suggested benefits if given early. This study's goal was to determine if early dexamethasone treatment improves outcomes in adults with bacterial meningitis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Use of dexamethasone in adult bacterial meningitis was not previously routine due to lack of data. This study leads to recommendations for the use of dexamethasone in adult cases of bacterial meningitis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">301 adults with suspected bacterial meningitis based on either cloudy cerebrospinal fluid, bacteria present in cerebrospinal fluid on Gram's stain, or a leukocyte count of more than 1000 per cubic millimeter.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Dexamethasone 10 mg IV or placebo given 15 to 20 minutes before or with the first dose of antibiotics, every 6 hours for four days.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary: Score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale at eight weeks.
Secondary: Death, focal neurologic abnormalities, hearing loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, fungal infection, herpes zoster, and hyperglycemia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Treatment with dexamethasone resulted in a significant reduction in unfavorable outcomes (15% for dexamethasone group vs. 25% for placebo, P=0.03). Mortality was also reduced (7% dexamethasone vs. 15% placebo, P=0.04), especially notable in pneumococcal meningitis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Selection bias concern due to comparison with a nationwide cohort.
- Delay in antibiotic therapy as a potential confounding factor, especially if CT scan was performed prior to lumbar puncture.
- Duration and timing of dexamethasone therapy could be further researched.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Partially funded by NV Organon, which also supplied the study medication.
