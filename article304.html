 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduce mortality from lung cancer?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Screening with low-dose CT in persons at high risk for lung cancer results in a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality compared to screening with chest radiography.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The NLST trial compared the effectiveness of low-dose CT with chest radiography in reducing lung cancer mortality among high-risk individuals. Findings demonstrated a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality with low-dose CT screening, which suggests that this screening modality can be beneficial in carefully selected patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">To be developed following analysis of the NLST and other trials' data, considering cost-effectiveness, harms from positive screening results and overdiagnosis, and competing interventions like smoking cessation. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving 53,454 participants considered at high risk for lung cancer who were randomized to three annual screenings with either low-dose CT or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Participants were aged 55-74, had a history of cigarette smoking of at least 30 pack-years, and, if former smokers, had quit within the previous 15 years. 
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Ages 55-74 at the time of randomization
- History of tobacco smoking of at least 30 pack-years
- If former smokers, cessation of smoking within the past 15 years
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Previous lung cancer diagnosis
- Chest CT within 18 months prior to enrollment
- Hemoptysis or unexplained weight loss over 15 pounds in the preceding year
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
Participants were demographically similar, approximately 94% former or current smokers, generally reflecting a "healthy-volunteer" effect.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Participants were randomized to three annual screenings with either low-dose CT or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
A 20% relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer was seen with low-dose CT screening. The number needed to screen to prevent one death from lung cancer was 320.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Overall mortality was reduced by 6.7% in the low-dose CT group. There was a high rate of false positive results in both groups, but these mostly stemmed from benign findings.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The “healthy-volunteer” effect may have biased results more favorably than in the community setting.
- Technological advancements in CT imaging may alter the effectiveness of screening.
- Trial conducted at expert centers, so results may not generalize to community facilities.
- Reduction in lung cancer mortality may differ with ongoing screening regimens beyond the three rounds of NLST.
- Potential harms include overdiagnosis and radiation exposure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for both the ACRIN and the Lung Screening Study sites of the NLST.
