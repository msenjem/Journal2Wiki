 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, does treatment with tafamidis reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, treatment with tafamidis significantly reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, as well as the decline in functional capacity and quality of life, compared with placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid fibrils composed of transthyretin protein in the heart, leading to cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Tafamidis is a benzoxazole derivative that binds to transthyretin, inhibiting its dissociation into monomers and subsequent amyloidogenesis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the last update, no specific guidelines for the use of tafamidis in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy were available.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">441 patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Between 18 and 90 years of age
- Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy confirmed by biopsy or scintigraphy
- Cardiac involvement confirmed by echocardiography, history of heart failure, NT-proBNP level above 600 pg/ml, and a 6-minute walk-test distance over 100 m
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Heart failure not due to transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy
- NYHA class IV heart failure
- Light-chain amyloidosis
- History of organ transplantation
- Implanted cardiac device
- Previous tafamidis treatment
- Estimated glomerular filtration rate lower than 25 ml/min/1.73mÂ²
- Liver transaminase levels exceeding two times the upper limit of normal
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Median age: 75 years
- Mostly male patients
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- 80 mg of tafamidis (n=264)
- 20 mg of tafamidis (n=264)
- Placebo (n=177)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Patients who received tafamidis had lower all-cause mortality and rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations than the placebo group (P<0.001), with a win ratio of 1.695.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Improvement in the distance walked during the 6-minute walk test and KCCQ-OS scores, indicating reduced decline in functional capacity and quality of life, respectively.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Sponsored by Pfizer.
