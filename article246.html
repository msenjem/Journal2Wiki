 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, bb2121 CAR T-cell therapy resulted in an 85% objective response rate, with a median progression-free survival of 11.8 months. Toxicity was manageable, with mostly low-grade cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxic effects.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multiple myeloma remains a disease with no curative treatment, and patients often experience relapse even after multiple lines of therapy. The CAR T-cell therapy bb2121 represents an innovative approach by redirecting the patient's own T cells to target BCMA, which is expressed on myeloma cells. This phase 1 study demonstrated substantial efficacy in a heavily pretreated population, with high response rates and durable remissions.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, no guidelines have been established for bb2121 in the context of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma due to the novelty of the treatment.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Open-label, phase 1, multicenter study with two parts: a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase.
N=33 patients who received bb2121.
Setting: Multiple centers in the United States.
Enrollment: 2016-2018.
Mean follow-up: 11.3 months.
Analysis: Intention-to-treat.
Primary outcome: Safety profile of bb2121 therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria:
- Age â‰¥18 years.
- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 0 or 1.
- Measurable disease with specific laboratory criteria.
- At least three previous lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, or refractory to both drug classes.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria:
- Patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria based on their medical condition and prior treatments.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Median age: 60 years (range, 37 to 75).
- Median time since diagnosis: 5 years (range, 1 to 36).
- Patients had received a median of 7 to 8 prior treatment regimens.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Single infusion of bb2121 with varying doses (50x10^6 to 800x10^6 CAR-positive [CAR+] T cells).
- Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Safety: Hematologic toxic effects most common, including neutropenia (85%), leukopenia (58%), anemia (45%), and thrombocytopenia (45%).
- Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 25 patients (76%), mostly grade 1 or 2.
- Neurologic toxic effects occurred in 42% of patients, with one reversible grade 4 event.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Objective response rate: 85%.
- Complete response rate: 45%.
- Median progression-free survival: 11.8 months.
- Persistence of CAR T cells was observed in 20% of patients at 12 months.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Small sample size in this phase 1 study limits the generalizability of the results.
- Longer follow-up is required to determine long-term durability of responses and potential late toxic effects.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by Bluebird Bio and Celgene.
