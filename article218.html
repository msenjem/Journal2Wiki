 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and suspected or confirmed infected necrotic tissue, a minimally invasive step-up approach reduced the rate of major complications or death, as well as long-term complications, health care resource utilization, and total costs, compared to primary open necrosectomy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Necrotizing pancreatitis, often leading to infection and sepsis, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The traditional treatment, open necrosectomy, is highly invasive and may cause further complications. Studies suggest that a less invasive step-up approach, utilizing percutaneous drainage followed by minimally invasive retroperitoneal necrosectomy only if necessary, may reduce complications and resource utilization.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines suggest using a minimally invasive approach to the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis with suspected or confirmed secondary infection.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">88 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and suspected/confirmed infected necrotic tissue.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusions:
- Acute pancreatitis with signs of pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis on contrast-enhanced CT.
- Confirmed or suspected infected necrosis.
- Decision made to perform a surgical intervention, and possibility for percutaneous or endoscopic drainage.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusions:
- Flare-up of chronic pancreatitis.
- Previous surgeries or interventions for the current episode.
- Pancreatitis due to abdominal surgery.
- Acute intraabdominal events necessitating surgery.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to either:
- Primary open necrosectomy (n=45) 
- Minimally invasive step-up approach (n=43): consisting of percutaneous drainage followed, if necessary, by minimally invasive retroperitoneal necrosectomy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome:
- Composite of major complications (new-onset multiple organ failure, multiple systemic complications, organ/enterocutaneous fistula perforation, intraabdominal bleeding) or death: 40% in the step-up group vs. 69% in the open necrosectomy group (risk ratio 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.87; P=0.006).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- New-onset multiple-organ failure occurred less in the step-up approach (12% vs. 40%, P=0.002).
- Death rates did not differ significantly (19% vs. 16%, P=0.70).
- Incisional hernias and new-onset diabetes were lower in the step-up group (P=0.03 and P=0.02, respectively).
- Health care resource utilization for operations was lower (P=0.004), and costs were 12% less in the step-up approach.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study did not have sufficient power to detect a significant difference in mortality rates between the two strategies.
