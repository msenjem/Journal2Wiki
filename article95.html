 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG), when added to medical therapy, improve survival in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, there was no significant difference between those who received medical therapy alone and those who received medical therapy plus CABG with respect to the primary end point of death from any cause. However, CABG did provide benefit with lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes and of death from any cause or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Randomized, comparative data had been lacking with respect to the benefits and risks of CABG in patients with coronary artery disease and non-acute heart failure. The Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial addressed this knowledge gap by comparing medical therapy alone with medical therapy plus CABG in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and coronary artery disease amenable to CABG. Although no significant difference was observed in the primary outcome of all-cause mortality, patients assigned to CABG experienced lower rates of cardiovascular mortality and a reduction in death or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes.

 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, nonblinded, randomized study
- N=1,212 patients with ejection fraction â‰¤35% and coronary artery disease amenable to CABG
- Medical therapy alone (n=602)
- Medical therapy plus CABG (n=610)
- Setting: 99 centers in 22 countries
- Enrollment: July 24, 2002, to May 5, 2007
- Median follow-up: 56 months
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Rate of death from any cause
