 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, does increasing the dose of dialysis or using a high-flux dialyzer membrane improve survival or reduce morbidity?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, neither increased dose of dialysis beyond the current U.S. recommended levels nor the use of high-flux membranes substantially improves survival or reduces morbidity when compared to a standard dose and low-flux membranes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">There has been uncertainty about whether higher doses of dialysis or higher flux dialyzer membranes would improve outcomes in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study, a randomized clinical trial, assessed the effects of dialysis dose and membrane flux on patient outcomes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current U.S. practice guidelines recommend a single-pool Kt/V of at least 1.24 but do not specifically recommend for or against the routine use of high-flux membranes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, two-by-two factorial clinical trial
N=1,846 patients undergoing thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis
Intervention groups:
Standard dose of dialysis (equilibrated Kt/V ~1.16) vs. high dose of dialysis (equilibrated Kt/V ~1.53)
Low-flux dialyzer (beta2-microglobulin clearance ~3 mL/min) vs. high-flux dialyzer (beta2-microglobulin clearance ~34 mL/min)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: Patients aged 18 to 80 undergoing thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis for â‰¥3 months
Exclusion Criteria: Serum albumin <2.6 g/dL, residual urea clearance >1.5 mL/min per 35 liters or inability to achieve equilibrated Kt/V >1.30 within 4.5 hours in test runs
Baseline Characteristics: Predominance of urban centers; high rates of hypertension (96%), diabetes (45%), and cardiac disease (80%)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Randomized 1:1 ratio to either a standard-dose or high-dose goal and to dialysis with either a low-flux or high-flux dialyzer.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome:
Death from any cause: no significant difference between dose groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.10, P=0.53) or between flux groups (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05, P=0.23)
Secondary Outcomes:
Hospitalizations for cardiac causes or death, hospitalizations for infection or death, decline in serum albumin levels or death, and hospitalizations not related to vascular access: no significant difference between dose or flux groups
Possible benefits of dose or flux interventions suggested in subgroups of patients
