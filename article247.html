 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Standard care for smoldering multiple myeloma has been observation until symptoms develop. However, this does not identify high-risk patients who may benefit from early intervention.
- This phase 3 study randomized 119 high-risk smoldering myeloma patients to early treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone followed by maintenance lenalidomide or to observation.
- Early treatment significantly increased time to progression to symptomatic myeloma and overall survival rate at 3 years (94% vs. 80%).
- Response rates were high, with 79% after induction phase and 90% during the maintenance phase.
- Treatment toxic effects were mainly low-grade, consisting primarily of grade 1 or 2 infections, asthenia, and hematologic adverse events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the knowledge cutoff date, there are no updated guidelines reflecting the results of this study.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open-label, phase 3 randomized controlled trial
- N=119
- Early treatment (n=57)
- Observation (n=62)
- Median follow-up: 40 months
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma within the previous 5 years.
- Exclusion criteria: Symptoms of active myeloma such as hypercalcemia, bone lesions, renal failure, or anemia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Treatment: 9 cycles of lenalidomide (25 mg/day for days 1-21) and dexamethasone (20 mg/day on days 1-4 and 12-15), followed by maintenance with lenalidomide (10 mg/day on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) for 2 years.
- Observation: No treatment until progression to symptomatic disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: Time to progression to symptomatic disease.
- Secondary: Response rate, overall survival, and safety.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open-label design may introduce bias.
- Did not assess the quality of life impact of early treatment.
- Some patients received other treatments off-protocol at the time of symptomatic progression. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The study was funded by Celgene with an unrestricted grant.
