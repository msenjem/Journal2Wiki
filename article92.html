 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among high-risk patients, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or mixed nuts resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events, supporting its use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The Mediterranean diet, characterized by high intake of olive oil, fruits, nuts, vegetables, cereals, moderate intake of fish and poultry, and low intake of dairy, red meat, processed meats, and sweets, has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in observational studies and a secondary prevention trial. This PREDIMED trial aimed to assess its effectiveness for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current findings support the benefits of the Mediterranean diet in reducing cardiovascular risk and are in line with dietary recommendations promoting its adoption for overall health improvement.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
- N=7,447 participants at high cardiovascular risk
- Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat)
- Median follow-up: 4.8 years
- The trial was stopped early due to the demonstrated benefits of the Mediterranean diet
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- High-risk individuals aged 55 to 80 years without cardiovascular disease
- Inclusion criteria: Type 2 diabetes mellitus or ≥3 major risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, elevated LDL cholesterol, etc.
- Baseline characteristics: balanced across the three study groups
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (~1 liter/week)
- Mediterranean diet with mixed nuts (30g/day)
- Control diet with advice to reduce dietary fat
- All groups received quarterly educational sessions; the Mediterranean groups received supplemental foods, and the control group received small nonfood gifts
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- Rate of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes): 
  - Group with extra-virgin olive oil: 3.8%, HR 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.91)
  - Group with mixed nuts: 3.4%, HR 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94)
  - Control group: 4.4%
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Stroke, myocardial infarction individually, death from cardiovascular causes, and death from any cause
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Findings mostly reflect the benefits of supplemental foods (olive oil, nuts)
- Dropout rates were higher in the control group
- Study's generalizability might be limited to high-risk Mediterranean populations
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by the Spanish government's Instituto de Salud Carlos III and others; food donors included extra-virgin olive oil and nut producers. The sponsors had no role in the trial design, data analysis, or reporting.
