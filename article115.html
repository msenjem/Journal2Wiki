                                        </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does dapagliflozin reduce the composite risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death among patients with heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 40%?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Dapagliflozin reduced the combined risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death among patients with heart failure and a mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated benefits in patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, but evidence for their effectiveness in individuals with a mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction was less defined before the DELIVER trial. This trial revealed that dapagliflozin also provided benefits to this patient group, thus supporting the broader use of SGLT2 inhibitors across the heart failure spectrum.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time the trial was published, recent guidelines had classified SGLT2 inhibitors as a class IIA, level B recommendation for treatment of heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. Results from the DELIVER trial may contribute to future updates in clinical guidelines for the management of these patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Phase 3, international, multicenter, parallel-group, event-driven, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
- N=6,263 patients with heart failure and ejection fraction >40%
- Intervention: Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily (n=3,131)
- Placebo plus usual therapy (n=3,132)
- Median follow-up: 2.3 years
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients aged â‰¥40 years with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 40%
- Included patients with stabilized heart failure, with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Randomly assigned to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo, along with their usual therapy
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: Composite of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death
- Secondary: Total number of heart failure events and cardiovascular deaths; change in total symptom score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire; cardiovascular death; death from any cause
- Safety: Incidence of adverse events
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria may limit generalizability.
- Less than 5% of enrolled patients were Black, and while proportional on a regional basis, it is unclear how these findings may apply globally.
- Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, completion of the 8-month symptom assessment was limited.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Supported by AstraZeneca.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Full trial details and protocol information are available in the New England Journal of Medicine, published August 27, 2022. </span></p>
