 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does early revascularization improve survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Early revascularization in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock did not significantly reduce overall 30-day mortality but did result in a significant survival benefit at six months.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction. Previous studies suggested that revascularization could improve outcomes, but these were non-randomized and potentially biased. This randomized controlled trial did not find a significant reduction in 30-day mortality with emergency revascularization compared to initial medical stabilization. However, revascularization did result in a significant survival benefit after six months, suggesting early revascularization should be strongly considered for these patients.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Contemporary guidelines recommend early revascularization for patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction, based on this trial's longer-term survival benefits.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized trial.
- N=302 patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.
- Emergency revascularization: 152 patients.
- Initial medical stabilization: 150 patients.
- Inclusion criteria included ST-segment elevation, Q-wave infarction, new left bundle-branch block, or posterior infarction with anterior ST-segment depression, plus shock due to left ventricular failure.
- Exclusion criteria included severe systemic illness, other causes of shock, severe valvular disease, and unsuitability for revascularization.
- Primary endpoint: Mortality at 30 days.
- Secondary endpoint: Six-month survival.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Mean age: 66Â±10 years.
- 32% women.
- 55% transferred from other hospitals.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Recent MI with ST-segment elevation, new Q-wave, new left bundle-branch block, or anterior ST depression with posterior MI.
- Cardiogenic shock confirmed by clinical and hemodynamic criteria.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Severe concurrent illness.
- Non-cardiogenic shock.
- Severe valvular disease.
- Ineligibility for revascularization.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Similar between revascularization and medical therapy groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Revascularization: Urgent coronary angiography followed by angioplasty or bypass surgery.
- Medical stabilization: Intensive medical therapy, recommended thrombolytic therapy, and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
- 30-day mortality: 46.7% for revascularization group, 56.0% for medical therapy group (P=0.11).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Six-month mortality: Significantly lower in the revascularization group (50.3%) compared to the medical therapy group (63.1%) (P=0.027).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The study was designed to detect a 20% absolute mortality difference at 30 days; not powered for smaller differences.
- The small number of very early randomizations precludes inferences about benefits of very early revascularization.
- Small number of elderly patients included limits conclusions for this subgroup.
