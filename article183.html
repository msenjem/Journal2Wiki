 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does the administration of hydrocortisone reduce 28-day mortality in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia being treated in the ICU?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia being treated in the ICU, the administration of hydrocortisone resulted in lower 28-day mortality compared with placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Community-acquired pneumonia can lead to severe systemic inflammation, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Previous trials suggested that glucocorticoids could reduce mortality among patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, but results were often inconclusive. The Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Evaluation of Corticosteroids (CAPE COD) trial demonstrated that early hydrocortisone therapy decreased 28-day mortality in patients admitted to the ICU for severe community-acquired pneumonia, with no significant increase in hospital-acquired infections or gastrointestinal bleeding.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The results of this study could influence future guidelines on the therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia in the ICU.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Double-blind, randomized, controlled superiority trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">795 adults admitted to the ICU for severe community-acquired pneumonia.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Adults â‰¥18 years
- Severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU admission
- Presence of specific severity criteria for pneumonia
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Do-not-intubate order
- Pneumonia caused by influenza
- Septic shock at baseline
- Other specified criteria
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Gender distributions, pathogen profiles, and other baseline health characteristics were detailed.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients randomized to hydrocortisone group received:
- 200mg intravenous hydrocortisone daily for 4 or 7 days based on clinical improvement, followed by tapering over a total of 8 or 14 days
- Standard therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia (antibiotics and supportive care)
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Patients in placebo group received:
- Intravenous saline with an identical regimen to the hydrocortisone group
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome:
- 28-day mortality rate (6.2% in the hydrocortisone group versus 11.9% in the placebo group, P=0.006)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- 90-day mortality rate
- Length of ICU stay
- Ventilator-free days and vasopressor-free days
- Incidence of endotracheal intubation in patients not ventilated at baseline
- Initiation of vasopressor therapy by day 28
- Changes in the Pao2:Fio2 ratio and SOFA score by day 7
- Quality of life assessed by SF-36 scores
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Lower than expected mortality in the control group suggests lower severity of illness than anticipated.
- No standardized microbiologic evaluation, with many patients with no documented pathogen.
- Exclusion of patients with septic shock.
- Did not evaluate the reversibility of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia.
