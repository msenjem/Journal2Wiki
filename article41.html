 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with moderate-to-high-risk atrial fibrillation, is edoxaban noninferior or superior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with moderate-to-high-risk atrial fibrillation, both high-dose and low-dose regimens of edoxaban were noninferior to warfarin for prevention of stroke or systemic embolism, with significantly lower rates of bleeding and death from cardiovascular causes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, showed noninferiority to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism among atrial fibrillation patients. High-dose edoxaban showed a trend toward superior efficacy compared to warfarin, while low-dose edoxaban was associated with less bleeding risk.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">As of the latest knowledge cut-off, this trial may influence guidelines by providing a new oral anticoagulant option for the management of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, especially for patients who have a moderate-to-high risk of stroke.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized controlled trial
- N=21,105
- Warfarin (n=7,031), High-dose edoxaban (n=7,036), Low-dose edoxaban (n=7,038)
- Setting: 1393 centers in 46 countries
- Enrollment: 2008-2010
- Mean follow-up: 2.8 years
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: Stroke or systemic embolism
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Age ≥ 21 years
- Atrial fibrillation documented within 12 months before randomization
- CHADS2 score of 2 or higher
- Anticoagulation therapy planned for duration of the trial
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Atrial fibrillation due to a reversible disorder
- Estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml per minute
- High risk of bleeding
- Use of dual antiplatelet therapy or other anticoagulation therapy
- Mitral stenosis or other indications requiring anticoagulation therapy
- Recent acute coronary syndromes, stroke, or inability to adhere to study procedures
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Demographics and clinical characteristics were well balanced among the three groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients were randomized to receive either warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0), high-dose edoxaban (60 mg), or low-dose edoxaban (30 mg).
- Dose was halved for patients with creatinine clearance of 30-50 ml per minute, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or concomitant use of potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- High-dose edoxaban showed noninferiority (and trend toward superiority) compared to warfarin (annualized rate 1.18% vs. 1.50%).
- Low-dose edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin (annualized rate 1.61% vs. 1.50%).
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Secondary Outcome
- Major bleeding rates were lower with high-dose edoxaban (2.75%) and low-dose edoxaban (1.61%) compared to warfarin (3.43%).
- Death rates from cardiovascular causes were lower with both doses of edoxaban than with warfarin.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- No specific antidote for edoxaban is available.
- Direct comparative studies are needed to determine real clinical differences compared to other new anticoagulants.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Supported by Daiichi Sankyo Pharma Development.
