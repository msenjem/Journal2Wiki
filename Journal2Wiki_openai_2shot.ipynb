Periprocedural administration of these oral agents can be challenging if there is significant nausea, dysphagia, or altered mental status. Cangrelor is an intravenous, fast-acting (half-life 2.9-5.5 minutes) antiplatelet medication that has rapidly reversible inhibition of the P2Y12receptor.[1]Its efficacy in PCI was unknown.Published 2013, the Cangrelor Versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet Inhibition (CHAMPION PHOENIX) trial randomized patients undergoing urgent or elective PCI to receive cangrelor (n=5472) or clopidogrel (n=5470). All patients also received aspirin. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, MI, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis. Cangrelor significantly reduced the risk of the primary outcome (4.7% vs. 5.9%; OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.66-0.93; P=0.005; NNT=83). There was no significant increase in the risk of severe bleeding. However, cangrelor treatment was associated with a higher risk of dyspnea. This complication was seen in thePLATOandEUCLID (Ticagrelor)trials investigating the similar reversible mediatedking, P2Y12antagonist ticagrelor.Despite the findings of this single trial, a meta-analysis including the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial and the phase 3 trials CHAMPION PCI and CHAMPION PLATFORM reported no difference in the risk of the primary outcome between patients treated with cangrelor or clopidogrel.[2]It is also unclear how cangrelor compares to the more potent P2Y12inhibitors, prasugrel and ticagrelor.[3]GuidelinesAs of June  2017, no guidelines have been published that reflect the results of this trial.DesignMulticenter, double-blind, randomized trialN=11,145Cangrelor (n=5472)Clopidogrel (n=5470)Setting: 153 centers in multiple countriesEnrollment: 2010-2012Follow-up: 48 hoursAnalysis: Modified intention-to-treatPrimary outcome: All-cause mortality, MI, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis within 48 hours post-randomizationPopulationInclusion CriteriaAge â‰¥18 yearsPCI indicated for 1 of these reasons:Stable angina with diagnostic coronary angiogram <90 days prior to randomizationNSTE-ACS with diagnostic coronary angiogram <72 hours prior to randomizationSTEMIExclusion CriteriaDetails are presented elsewhere.[4][5]Treatment with P2Y12receptor antagonist, or abciximab within 7 days prior to randomizationTreatment with eptifibatide, tirofiban, or fibrinolytic therapy within 12 hours prior to randomizationHypertension (systolic BP >180 mm Hg or diastolic BP >110 mm Hg) inadequately controlled by antihypertensive therapyImpaired hemostasis, coagulopathy, or thrombocytopeniaPlanned admission for <12 hours post-PCIPlanned PCI where the second stage will occur â‰¤30 d after the initial interventionAllergy or contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel, cangrelor, mannitol, sorbitol, or microcrystalline cellulosePregnancy or lactation, other investigational drug/device use, prior enrollment in this protocolBaseline CharacteristicsFrom the cangrelor groupDemographics: Age 64 years, 28% female, 94% white race; 37% from United StatesWeight: 84 kgDiagnosis: Stable angina 57%; NSTE-ACS 25%, STEMI 18%; normal cardiac-biomarker (64.4%)PMH: DM 28%, active smoker 28%, HTN 80%, HLD 69%, stroke or TIA 5%, PAD 8%, previous MI 20%, HF 10%PSH: PTCA or PCI 23%, CABG 11%Periprocedural medications: clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose 26%; 600 mg loading dose 74%), bivalirudin 23%, unfractionated heparin 78%, LMWH 13%, fondaparinux 3%, ASA 94%PCI specifics: Duration 18 min, DES 56%, BMS 42%, balloon angioplasty 5%InterventionsPatients were randomized, in a double-blind manner to a group:Cangrelor- IV cangrelor bolus of 30 Î¼g/kg followed by an infusion of 4 Î¼g/kg/min for â‰¥2 hours or the duration of the procedure (whichever is longer) and placebo capsulesClopidogrel- Placebo infusion then clopidogrel loading dose 600 mg or 300 mgBoth groups received the following:Aspirin 75-325 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg, during the first 48 hoursThe investigator selects the periprocedural anticoagulant of choiceGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were used only as rescue therapy during PCIOutcomesComparisons are cangrelor vs. clopidogrel.

Safety outcomes appear to have excluded only those who did not receive the study drug while the efficacy outcomes excluded those who did not undergo PCI or those who did not receive the study drug. There were 91 and 83 more participants in the safety mITT population. It is unclear to the WJC editors if these extra participants who received the study drug but did not undergo PCI had different bleeding rates by treatment assignment.

This is thought to be a less effective loading dose which may lead to inadequate platelet inhibition and greater likelihood of ischemic events. Further, clopidogrel is inferior to ticagrelor and prasugrel in reducing PCI complications. It is not clear how cangrelor compares to these other agents.[9]The extent of myocardial damage was not evaluated when patients were treated with urgent PCI.[10]Little racial diversityFundingThe Medicines Company, the manufacturer or Kengreal (the brand name of cangrelor).Further Readingâ†‘Storey RF et al.

Cangrelor is a potent intravenous adenosine diphosphate (ADP)â€“receptor antagonist that acts rapidly and has quickly reversible effects. METHODS In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 11,145 patients who were undergoing either urgent or elective PCI and were receiving guideline-recommended therapy to receive a bolus and infusion of cangrelor or to receive a loading dose of 600 mg or 300 mg of clopidogrel. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis at 48 hours after randomization; the key secondary end point was stent thrombosis at 48 hours. The primary safety end point was severe bleeding at 48 hours. RESULTS The rate of the primary efficacy end point was 4.7% in the cangrelor group and 5.9% in the clopidogrel group (adjusted odds ratio with cangrelor, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.93; P=0.005). The rate of the primary safety end point was 0.16% in the cangrelor group and 0.11% in the clopidogrel group (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.53 to 4.22; P=0.44). Stent thrombosis developed in 0.8% of the patients in the cangrelor group and in 1.4% in the clopidogrel group (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.90; P=0.01). The rates of adverse events related to the study treatment were low in both groups, though transient dyspnea occurred significantly more frequently with cangrelor than with clopidogrel (1.2% vs. 0.3%). The benefit from cangrelor with respect to the primary end point was consistent across multiple prespecified subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Cangrelor significantly reduced the rate of ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, during PCI, with no significant increase in severe bleeding. (Funded by the Medicines Company; CHAMPION PHOENIX ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01156571 . opens in new tab .) Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation is widely used to reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndromes and to reduce the burden of angina and improve the quality of life in patients with stable angina.1-5 Despite advances in adjunctive pharmacotherapy, thrombotic complications during PCI remain a major concern.6 Antiplatelet therapies, including the P2Y12-receptor inhibitors, reduce the risk of ischemic events, particularly stent thrombosis.7-10 To date, only oral P2Y12 inhibitors have been available. There are several limitations of these drugs when they are used for urgent or periprocedural treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease who may undergo PCI, including a delayed onset of action. Patients in the acute phase of cardiovascular illness may have conditions such as nausea, impaired absorption, or impaired perfusion that can limit drug bioavailability, and in such patients, the antiplatelet effect of the oral antiplatelet agent clopidogrel may not be sufficient.11,12 In addition, multiple sources of variation in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel have been described.13 More potent oral agents such as prasugrel and ticagrelor are also subject to some of these limitations.14-16 Intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors can be effective in reducing the incidence of ischemic events, but their effects last for at least several hours and cannot be quickly reversed.17 A potent, intravenous, fast-acting, reversible antiplatelet agent could address this unmet clinical need. Cangrelor is an intravenous, fast-acting, potent, and direct-acting platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) P2Y12 inhibitor that has rapidly reversible effects. When a bolus of cangrelor is administered, the antiplatelet effect is immediate, and the effect can be maintained with a continuous infusion. The plasma half-life of cangrelor is approximately 3 to 5 minutes, and platelet function is restored within 1 hour after cessation of the infusion.18 The use of cangrelor in patients undergoing PCI was studied in two phase 3 trials, the Cangrelor versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet Inhibition (CHAMPION) PCI and CHAMPION PLATFORM studies. Cangrelor was not associated with a significant reduction in the primary efficacy end point in either of these trials but was associated with reductions in secondary end points, including the rate of stent thrombosis, with no excess in severe bleeding.19-22 The CHAMPION PHOENIX trial was designed to evaluate prospectively whether cangrelor does indeed reduce ischemic complications of PCI. Methods STUDY OVERSIGHT The design of the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial has been published previously23 and is summarized in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The trial was designed by an academic executive committee (see the Supplementary Appendix) and the sponsor (the Medicines Company). The data were collected by the sponsor. The Duke Clinical Research Institute received regular transfers of data from the sponsor and was responsible for coordinating activities and analyses for the independent data and safety monitoring board. At the end of the trial, the full database was transferred to the Duke Clinical Research Institute for primary and secondary analyses. These analyses were performed independently; the results were subsequently compared with the results obtained by the sponsor, and discrepancies were resolved collaboratively. The first author prepared the first draft of the manuscript, which was then reviewed and edited by the executive committee and other coauthors. The sponsor had the right to review but not approve the final manuscript. The first and last authors accept full responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the reported analyses and interpretations of the data, as well as for the fidelity of this report to the protocol (which is available at NEJM.org), and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. STUDY PATIENTS We intended this trial to be a large, generalizable study. Eligible patients were men or nonpregnant women 18 years of age or older with coronary atherosclerosis who required PCI for stable angina, a nonâ€“ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and who did not receive pretreatment with platelet inhibitors. Patients were required to provide written informed consent. Major exclusion criteria were receipt of a P2Y12 inhibitor or abciximab at any time in the 7 days before randomization and receipt of eptifibatide or tirofiban or fibrinolytic therapy in the 12 hours before randomization. STUDY TREATMENT Patients were randomly assigned, in a double-dummy, double-blind manner, to receive cangrelor or clopidogrel before PCI. Randomization was performed with the use of an interactive voice-response or Web-response system, with stratification according to site, baseline status (normal or abnormal, as defined by a combination of biomarker levels, electrocardiographic changes, and symptoms), and intended loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg or 300 mg). After randomization, patients received an infusion of cangrelor or matching placebo and the first set of capsules containing either 600 mg or 300 mg of clopidogrel (with the dose determined at the discretion of the site investigator) or matching placebo. At the end of the infusion, patients received a second set of capsules containing either 600 mg of clopidogrel (cangrelor group) or matching placebo (clopidogrel group) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Cangrelor or matching placebo was administered as a bolus of 30 Î¼g per kilogram of body weight followed by an infusion of 4 Î¼g per kilogram per minute for at least 2 hours or the duration of the procedure, whichever was longer. The protocol called for aspirin (75 to 325 mg) to be administered to all patients. The protocol also called for clopidogrel (75 mg) to be administered during the first 48 hours; thereafter, clopidogrel or another P2Y12 inhibitor could be administered at the discretion of the investigator, according to local guidelines. The choice of a periprocedural anticoagulant (bivalirudin, unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or fondaparinux) was also at the discretion of the investigator. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were allowed only as rescue therapy during PCI to treat new or persistent thrombus formation, slow or no reflow, side-branch compromise, dissection, or distal embolization. The investigator at the site determined the protocol for management of the arterial sheath. END POINTS The primary efficacy end point was the composite rate of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis in the 48 hours after randomization in the modified intention-to-treat population (which comprised patients who actually underwent PCI and received the study drug). The protocol specified that if more than 15% of the patients received a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel (as compared with a 600-mg dose) at the time of randomization, the primary analysis was to be adjusted for loading dose in addition to baseline status. The key secondary end point was the incidence of stent thrombosis at 48 hours; this end point included definite stent thrombosis, defined according to the criteria of the Academic Research Consortium, or intraprocedural stent thrombosis, which was assessed, with group assignments concealed, at an angiographic core laboratory (Cardiovascular Research Foundation).24 Intraprocedural stent thrombosis was defined as any new or worsened thrombus related to the stent procedure that was confirmed angiographically. Events of death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, and stent thrombosis that occurred during the first 30 days after randomization were adjudicated by the clinical events committee at the Duke Clinical Research Institute. The criteria that the clinical events committee used to define myocardial infarction are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. The primary safety end point was severe bleeding not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting, according to the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) criteria, at 48 hours. Several other bleeding definitions were also applied. Bleeding end points were not adjudicated. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS On the basis of prior studies, we assumed that the rate of the composite primary end point would be 5.1% in the clopidogrel group and 3.9% in the cangrelor group, representing a 24.5% reduction in the odds ratio with cangrelor. We estimated that we would need to enroll approximately 10,900 patients for the study to have 85% power to detect that reduction. A two-sided overall alpha level of 0.05 was used for all analyses. This study had an adaptive design with conditional power calculation and potential for reestimation of the sample size, if necessary, after the interim analysis that was scheduled to be performed after 70% of the patients were enrolled.25 The numbers and percentages of patients within each analysis population (modified intention-to-treat, intention-to-treat, and safety) were summarized according to treatment group. The primary efficacy analysis of the rate of the composite end point of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis (with all events adjudicated by the clinical events committee) in the 48 hours after randomization was conducted in the modified intention-to-treat population. The primary safety analysis was conducted in the safety population, which comprised all patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of the study drug; patients were classified according to the actual treatment received. All calculations and statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.2. Results PATIENTS . Baseline Characteristics of the Patients and Characteristics of the Procedure in the Modified Intention-to-Treat Population, According to Treatment Group. A total of 11,145 patients underwent randomization at 153 sites from September 30, 2010, to October 3, 2012. Of the patients who were randomly assigned to a study group, 203 did not undergo PCI or did not receive a study drug; therefore, the modified intention-to-treat population comprised 10,942 patients (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups (). The average age of the patients was 64 years, and 28% were women. The diagnosis at presentation was stable angina in 56.1% of the patients, nonâ€“ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome in 25.7% (5.7% had unstable angina), and STEMI in 18.2%. Overall, the median time from hospital admission to PCI was 4.4 hours (interquartile range, 1.9 to 21.0). The characteristics of the procedure are shown in . A total of 55.6% of the patients received drug-eluting stents and 42.4% received bare-metal stents. Additional baseline characteristics of the patients and characteristics of the procedure are provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. END POINTS . Kaplanâ€“Meier Curves for the Primary Efficacy End Point. . Efficacy and Safety End Points at 48 Hours after Randomization. . Kaplanâ€“Meier Curves for the Key Secondary End Point. The rate of the primary composite efficacy end point of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis at 48 hours was significantly lower in the cangrelor group than in the clopidogrel group (4.7% vs. 5.9%; odds ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.93; P=0.005), on the basis of the prespecified logistic-regression analysis, which adjusted for baseline status (normal vs. abnormal) and clopidogrel loading dose (600 mg vs. 300 mg). The result of the crude analysis was similar (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.93; P=0.006).  shows the Kaplanâ€“Meier estimates of the time-to-event distributions for the primary end point. The number needed to treat with cangrelor to prevent one primary end-point event is 84 (95% CI, 49 to 285). The results of analyses of the components of the primary end point and other composite end points are provided in  and in Tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. The rate of the key secondary efficacy end point of stent thrombosis at 48 hours was also lower in the cangrelor group than in the clopidogrel group (0.8% vs. 1.4%; odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.90; P=0.01) ( and ). At 30 days, the rate of the composite efficacy end point remained significantly lower in the cangrelor group than in the clopidogrel group (6.0% vs. 7.0%; odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.99; P=0.03); the relative reduction in stent thrombosis also persisted (1.3% vs. 1.9%; odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.92; P=0.01). The rate of intraprocedural stent thrombosis was lower in the cangrelor group than in the clopidogrel group (0.6% vs. 1.0%; odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.99; P=0.04). The use of rescue therapy with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor was 2.3% with cangrelor as compared with 3.5% with clopidogrel (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.82; P<0.001). The rate of procedural complications was lower with cangrelor than with clopidogrel (3.4% vs. 4.5%; odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.90; P=0.002). The rate of the primary safety end point, GUSTO-defined severe bleeding, was 0.16% in the cangrelor group as compared with 0.11% in the clopidogrel group (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.53 to 4.22; P=0.44). Bleeding events according to several other bleeding definitions were also examined (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). In a post hoc analysis, the primary efficacy end point and the primary safety end point were combined to provide a composite end point of the net rate of adverse clinical events, which was 4.8% in the cangrelor group as compared with 6.0% in the clopidogrel group (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.94; P=0.008). ADVERSE EVENTS The rate of adverse events related to treatment (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix) was similar in the cangrelor and clopidogrel groups (20.2% and 19.1%, respectively; P=0.13); 0.5% of these adverse events in the cangrelor group and 0.4% of those in the clopidogrel group led to discontinuation of the study drug (P=0.21). There were significantly more cases of transient dyspnea with cangrelor than with clopidogrel (1.2% vs. 0.3%, P<0.001). SUBGROUP ANALYSES . Subgroup Analysis of the Primary Efficacy End Point. The reduction in the primary efficacy end point with cangrelor was consistent across multiple subgroups, with no significant interactions with baseline variables except for status with respect to a history of peripheral-artery disease (). The benefit with cangrelor was similar among patients presenting with STEMI, those presenting with nonâ€“ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, and those presenting with stable angina. There was no heterogeneity of treatment effect between patients in the United States and those in other countries (P=0.26). According to the protocol, patients received a loading dose of clopidogrel or placebo after their coronary anatomy was delineated. The majority of patients received the loading dose before PCI was started (63.4%). The rest of the patients received the loading dose in the catheterization laboratory before PCI was completed (6.4%), within 1 hour after PCI was completed (30.1%), or more than 1 hour after PCI was completed (0.1%). There was no significant difference in the effect of cangrelor on the primary end point between patients who received the loading dose immediately before PCI (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.98) and those who received it during or after PCI (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.06) (P=0.99 for interaction). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the effect of cangrelor on the primary end point between patients who received a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel (74.4% of the population) and those who received a 300-mg loading dose (25.6% of the population): the odds ratio for the primary end point with cangrelor was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.94) with the 600-mg loading dose and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.62 to 1.14) with the 300-mg loading dose (P=0.62 for interaction). The protocol required at least 2 hours of study-drug infusion; the median duration of infusion in the cangrelor group was 129 minutes (interquartile range, 120 to 146); the duration of infusion was similar in the clopidogrel group (in which patients received a placebo infusion). A subgroup analysis showed a similar effect of cangrelor among patients who received the infusion for 129 minutes or less (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.07) and those who received the infusion for more than 129 minutes (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.92) (P=0.31 for interaction). Since the rate of the primary safety end point, GUSTO-defined severe bleeding, was very low, severe bleeding according to GUSTO criteria was combined with moderate bleeding to provide a larger number of events for an analysis of potential subgroup interactions. There were no interactions at P<0.05 (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Discussion As compared with clopidogrel administered immediately before or after PCI, intravenous ADP-receptor blockade with cangrelor significantly reduced the rate of periprocedural complications of PCI, including stent thrombosis. A reduction in the rate of acute periprocedural myocardial infarction accounted for most of the benefit. The odds of an ischemic event were 22% lower with cangrelor than with clopidogrel, and this benefit was not accompanied by a significant increase in severe bleeding or in the need for transfusions. More sensitive measures did show an increase in bleeding with cangrelor, as would be expected with a potent antithrombotic agent. The rates of transient dyspnea were very low but were higher with cangrelor than with clopidogrel, a finding that was also observed in the prior CHAMPION studies. The use of cangrelor resulted in a reduction in ischemic complications across the full spectrum of patients undergoing contemporary PCI, with a consistent benefit in major subgroups. The previous CHAMPION studies of cangrelor during PCI had suggested a clinical benefit, including a significant reduction in the secondary end point of stent thrombosis.19,22 However, the rate of the primary end point was not reduced in the previous studies, probably because the definition of periprocedural myocardial infarction in those studies did not allow discrimination of reinfarction in patients presenting for PCI soon after admission with a biomarker-positive acute coronary syndrome.21 In the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial, the definition of periprocedural myocardial infarction required careful assessment of patients' baseline biomarker status.23 In addition, the use of an angiographic core laboratory allowed objective determination of intraprocedural complications. Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix lists the differences between the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial and the CHAMPION PLATFORM and CHAMPION PCI trials. Beyond its role in reducing ischemic complications of PCI, cangrelor may be useful in clinical situations in which ADP-receptor blockade is needed but a short-acting intravenous agent would be preferred. For example, in patients waiting to undergo open-heart surgery, cangrelor (at a lower dose than that used in this study) has been shown to result in consistent platelet inhibition without a significant increase in bleeding.26 There are some limitations of the current study. A 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel is known to be superior to a 300-mg dose in some, though not all, patients undergoing PCI.27-29 However, the results of the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial were similar after adjustment for loading dose and in each loading-dose subgroup. It is possible that the results observed here would have been attenuated if the duration of oral antiplatelet pretreatment had been longer, though both a drug and a strategy were being tested in the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial. Furthermore, although pretreatment with clopidogrel before coronary angiography has been shown in some, though not all, studies to reduce ischemic events,30-32 it does necessitate treatment before delineation of the coronary anatomy, which might then be problematic if emergency cardiac surgery is required or intraprocedural complications such as perforation of the coronary artery occur. In addition, in patients with nausea or emesis, in those who are intubated or receiving hypothermic therapy, or in those with impaired perfusion (e.g., patients with a large myocardial infarction), adequate absorption of oral medications cannot be ensured.11,12 Studies show that administration of even the more potent oral antiplatelet agents prasugrel and ticagrelor may not result in maximal platelet inhibition in high-risk patients undergoing PCI.14,16 Future studies are needed to determine the most effective way to transition patients from cangrelor to prasugrel or ticagrelor. Intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are effective antiplatelet agents, but their antiplatelet effect does not stop quickly after cessation of the infusion, and they have been associated with an excess in episodes of major bleeding.17 In conclusion, intravenous ADP-receptor inhibition with cangrelor significantly reduced the rate of ischemic events across the entire spectrum of patients undergoing PCI, with a consistent benefit in all major subgroups.

Hydrocortisone therapy also failed to result in improvement in time to septic shock or short- or intermediate-term mortality. Hydrocortisone was associated with a 10% absolute increase in hyperglycemia and an absolute 13% reduction in delirium.Major PointsMultiple RCTs have investigated the potential role for steroid therapy in patients with septic shock. TheAnnane Trialin 2002 demonstrated a short-term mortality benefit with IV hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone among patients with evidence of adrenal insufficiency on ACTH stimulation testing. The more recentCORTICUSstudy investigated hydrocortisone in patients with and without adrenal insufficiency and found no benefit in either subgroup with suggestion of increased infection rates in patients receiving hydrocortisone. Since the patient population in the Annane Trial were more critically ill, a benefit to steroid therapy in sicker patients could not be excluded. In addition, in both trials shock was more rapidly reversed with the use of corticosteroids. As a result of these conflicting data with possible benefit, the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines provide a weak Grade 2C recommendation for the use of IV corticosteroids in septic shock refractory to IV fluids and pressor therapy.More recently, in a smaller RCT in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, hydrocortisone significantly improved survival and prevented progression to septic shock.[1]Further data investigating the effect of corticosteroids on patients with severe infection with regard to delaying or preventing progression to septic shock were needed.The 2016 Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock (HYPRESS) trial randomized 380 patients with severe sepsis without shock to IV hydrocortisone or placebo and assessed short-term prevalence of septic shock as the primary outcome. At 14 days, hydrocortisone had no beneficial effect on the development of septic shock versus placebo. Furthermore, there was no difference with regard to 28- or 90-day mortality or time to development of shock. Interestingly, there was a 13% absolute reduction in delirium in the corticosteroid group. Generally, hydrocortisone was well-tolerated with no evidence of excess infections with hydrocortisone therapy although there was a 10% absolute increase in hyperglycemia in the corticosteroid group. Ultimately, HYPRESS provides further evidence that corticosteroid therapy should be reserved for patients with refractory septic shock and patients with severe sepsis without shock do not appear to benefit from corticosteroid therapy. These findings are somewhat in conflict with emerging data suggesting benefit of corticosteroid therapy in patients with severe pneumonia, but this discrepancy can likely be explained by inclusion of a broad range of infections in the HYPRESS trial (only 45% of patients had PNA).GuidelinesAs of November  2016, no guidelines have been published that reflect the results of this trial.DesignMulticenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCTN=380IV hydrocortisone (n=190)Placebo (n=190)Setting: 34 sites in GermanyEnrollment: January 13, 2009 to August 27, 2013Duration of follow-up: 14 days (primary outcome)Analysis: Intention-to-treatPrimary outcome: Prevalence of septic shock at 14 daysPopulationInclusion CriteriaEvidence of infectionEvidence of systemic response to infection, defined as two or more ofWBC > 12 or < 4 or > 13% bandsTemp â‰¥ 38 or â‰¤ 36HR â‰¥ 90Tachypnea, hypocapnia, or mechanical ventilationEvidence of organ dysfunction for not longer than 48 hoursProvided informed consentExclusion CriteriaSeptic shockAge <18Known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or mannitol (placebo)History of glucocorticoid medication with indication for continuing therapy or other indications for treatment with glucocorticoidsBaseline CharacteristicsFrom the placebo armDemographics: Age 65, male 63%Type of admission: Elective surgery 24%, emergency surgery 18%, elective nonsurgery 2%, emergency nonsurgery 56%Sepsis severity: SOFA 2.4, APACHE II 6.0, SAPS II 9.9, SAPS 3 11.0SIRS criteria: Fever 80%, tachycardia 93%, tachypnea 89%, leukocytosis/leukopenia 75.0%Shock parameters: Refractory hypotension 54%, hyperlactemia 65%, mean lactate 7 mmol/L, supplemental O2 74%, ICU need 67%, APACHE II score 18.7, MEDS score 8.0, SOFA score 4.2Organ dysfunction: CNS 27%, coagulation 15%, pulmonary 68%, renal 42%, microcirculatory 30%Source of infection: Community 47%, nosocomial ICU 30%, nosocomial ward 23%Focus of infection: Pneumonia 53%, other respiratory 7%, thoracic 1%, GI 5%, intra-abdominal 16%, primary bacteremia 1%, bones/soft tissue 10%, surgical 2%, urogenital 14%, catheter 2%Interventions1:1 randomization to IV hydrocortisone versus placeboRandomization stratified by participating center and sexSeptic shock defined as sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate volume status for longer than 4 hoursHypotension defined as mean arterial pressure < 65mmHg, systolic arterial pressure < 90mmHg, or the use of vasopressors to keep mean arterial pressure â‰¥ 90mmHgAdequate volume status defined as CVP of 8mmHg or greater (â‰¥ 12mmHg in ventilated patients) and a ScvO2 > 70%Hydrocortisone was administered as an IV bolus of 50mg followed by a 24-hour continuous infusion of 200mg for days 1-5, 100mg for days 6-7, 50mg for days 8-9, and 25mg for days 10-11OutcomesComparisons are hydrocortisone versus placebo.Primary OutcomesSeptic shock at 14 days21.2% [95% CI 15.6-28.1] vs. 22.9% [95% CI 17.2-30.0] (P=0.70)Secondary OutcomesMortality at 28 days8.8% [95% CI 5.4-14.0] vs. 8.2% [95% CI 5.0-13.4] (P=0.86)Mortality at 180 days26.8% [95% CI 20.7-34.0] vs. 22.2% [95% CI 16.5-29.0] (P=0.32)SOFA score at day 144.7 [95% CI 3.5-6.5] vs. 5.0 [95% CI 3.5-6.8] (P=0.69)Delirium11.2% [95% CI 6.4-19.0] vs. 24.5% [95% CI 17.2-33.7] (P=0.01)Subgroup AnalysisThere was no significant difference regarding the primary and secondary end points between those with and without relative adrenal insufficiency who received hydrocortisone versus placeboAdverse EventsSecondary infection40 (21.5%) vs. 32 (16.9%) (P=0.26)Hyperglycemia169 (90.9%) vs. 154 (81.5%) (P=0.009)CriticismsThe trial was powered to detect an absolute difference of 15% in the development of septic shock at 14 days. As a result, a smaller benefit with hydrocortisone cannot be ruled out.The observed rate of septic shock in the placebo group (23%) was lower than originally presumed for sample size calculation (40%), again reducing sensitivity for this outcome.Patients were enrolled with a variety of infections. As a result, a benefit of corticosteroid therapy in reducing septic shock in specific populations (e.g., patients with pneumonia), cannot be ruled out.Secondary analyses not corrected for multiple comparisons, making certain findings (e.g., benefit of steroids on delirium) possibly due to chance.FundingStudy supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFurther Readingâ†‘Confalonieri M et al.

Resuscitation involved administration of fluids, vasopressors, and packed RBC transfusions guided by MAP, CVP, ScvO2 (which required central line placement), and UOP in the first 6 hours. The following year the international Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) was established to promote evidence-based approaches for reducing mortality from sepsis;[1]its guidelines reflect the EGDT protocol with a grade 1C recommendation.[2]Institutions implementing EGDT-like strategies have reported mortality reductions.[3]It\\'s impossible to determine which of the EGDT resuscitation interventions conferred survival benefit. Transfusions to maintain a hematocrit of 30 for low ScvO2 is in contrast to the deleterious effects of excessive transfusions in a similar population in theTRICCtrial (1999). ScvO2-driven resuscitation itself requires placement of a central venous catheter and did not differ in outcomes driven by lactate in EMSchockNet (2010).[4]CVP has been known to poorly correlate with blood volume in critically ill patients since 1984.[5]A multicenter trial confirming the benefit of the EGDT interventions was lacking.The 2014 Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) multicenter trial randomized 1,341 patients with septic shock to one of three arms: 1. EGDT-like care, 2. a novel protocol-based care using non-invasive monitoring to drive resuscitation, or 3. usual care as directed by the treating physicians (albeit in academic institutions in a closely monitored research setting). The EGDT group received more vasopressors, dobutamine, and blood transfusions than the other two groups. The protocol-based care group received more volume through hour 6 and total volume through hour 72 than the other two groups. At 60 days, 90 days, and 1 year there was no differences in mortality between the three arms. The protocol-based care was associated with higher degree of renal failure. Usual care had a non-significant reduction in heart failure (P=0.06).The EGDT protocol used here differs from that in the Rivers trial in several ways. Volume resuscitation in this trial startedbeforerandomization due to inclusion criteria requiring a fluid challenge. Because of this, the EGDT arm received 44.5% of administered volume until hour 6 before randomization occurred. This resulted in the \"early\" component of resuscitation lasting longer than the 6 hours in the Rivers trial. Furthermore, timing of non-resuscitation therapies (i.e. antibiotics) were left to the discretion of the investigator though most of the participants received antibiotics before randomization. Finally, in the >10 years since the Rivers trial was published, the practice of critical care medicine has changed considerably given the SSC\\'s emphasis on early identification of and treatment for those with sepsis. The very guidelines driving the standard of care in this field are heavily influenced by the Rivers trial. Indeed, all three groups in this trial received similar volume administration at 6 hours as the EGDT group in the Rivers trial.The findings of ProCESS were later confirmed in the 2014ARISEand 2015ProMISetrials[6]which compared EGDT and usual care in academic and community centers and NHS hospitals, respectively. The true benefit of modern therapies for septic shock may lie in the early identification of those with the condition which would ultimately lead toanearly treatment, rather than a specific algorithm.[7]GuidelinesSurviving Sepsis Campaign severe sepsis and septic shock(2016, adapted)[8]Begin treatment and resuscitation immediately (best practice statement [BPS] are ungraded, strong
