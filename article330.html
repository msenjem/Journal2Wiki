 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, is rituximab as effective as cyclophosphamide for inducing remission?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Rituximab was not inferior to cyclophosphamide for inducing remission in patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis and may be superior in patients with relapsing disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">ANCA-associated vasculitis, which includes Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis, has traditionally been treated with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids for remission induction. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown promise in uncontrolled studies for remission induction in ANCA-associated vasculitis. The Rituximab in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (RAVE) trial demonstrated that rituximab was not inferior to cyclophosphamide for inducing remission and may be superior in relapsing disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">No formal guidelines were discussed in this article. However, the RAVE trial contributes significantly to the evidence base for using rituximab in the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, noninferiority trial
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria: ANCA-positive patients with Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis and a BVAS/WG score of ≥3.
Exclusion Criteria: Severe alveolar hemorrhage requiring ventilatory support or advanced renal dysfunction (serum creatinine >4.0 mg/dL).
Baseline Characteristics: Similar between two groups, including disease activity, organ involvement, and proportion of relapsing disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Rituximab group received intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m^2 weekly for 4 weeks) plus daily placebo-cyclophosphamide.
Control group received placebo-rituximab infusions plus daily cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg per day).
Both groups were tapered off of glucocorticoids.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome: Remission of disease without prednisone use at 6 months.
Secondary Outcomes: Rates of disease flares, BVAS/WG score, cumulative glucocorticoid doses, rates of adverse events, and quality of life (SF-36 scores).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Long-term management, including retreatment with rituximab, was not addressed. The trial only included patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis who were ANCA-positive.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Genentech, Biogen, and others.
