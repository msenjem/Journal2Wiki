 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with early septic shock presenting to the emergency department, EGDT did not reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days when compared to usual care.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines endorsed EGDT as a key strategy for reducing mortality in septic shock based on results from a 2001 trial. However, subsequent studies, such as the ARISE trial, have questioned the efficacy of EGDT as standard of care. The large, multicenter ARISE trial conducted predominantly in Australia and New Zealand compared EGDT to usual care, finding no significant difference in 90-day mortality between the two groups.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">At the time of the study publication, EGDT was included in international guidelines for the treatment of septic shock but this study suggests reconsidering its value as a standard of care.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group trial
- N=1,600 (EGDT group: n=796; usual care group: n=804)
- Setting: 51 centers in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Hong Kong, and Ireland
- Enrollment: October 5, 2008 - April 23, 2014
- Follow-up: 90 days
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
- Primary outcome: All-cause mortality within 90 days after randomization
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Adult patients (â‰¥18 years) with early septic shock (refractory hypotension or hypoperfusion) within 6 hours of emergency department presentation
- Interventions: EGDT group received specific protocol-based therapies for 6 hours; usual-care group treatments were determined by treating clinicians without a protocol
- Exclusion criteria: Significant limitations to treatment (e.g., DNR status), eligible life expectancy less than 90 days, pregnancy, transfer from another hospital with septic shock, acute cerebral vascular event, acute coronary syndrome, acute pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, status epilepticus, drug overdose, traumatic injury, burn injury, surgery or interventional radiology within the past 12 hours, contraindication to central venous catheterization, and enrollment in another interventional trial
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: All-cause mortality at 90 days (EGDT: 18.6%, usual care: 18.8%; P=0.90)
- Secondary: No significant differences in survival time, in-hospital mortality, duration of organ support, or length of hospital stay
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The implementation of the EGDT and usual-care protocols might have differed across the diverse settings within multicenter trials, which may affect reproducibility of the study results.
