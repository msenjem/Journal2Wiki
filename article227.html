 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with betrixaban did not significantly reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients compared to standard-duration enoxaparin in the prespecified primary efficacy cohort. Exploratory analyses suggest a possible benefit in larger patient cohorts.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The APEX trial investigated whether extended prophylaxis with betrixaban reduces venous thromboembolism in hospitalized acutely ill medical patients. Although the primary efficacy outcome did not show a significant difference between betrixaban and enoxaparin in the cohort with elevated d-dimer levels, exploratory analyses in larger cohorts indicated potential benefits of betrixaban.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">No clear guidelines were established based on this study for the extension of thromboprophylaxis after hospital discharge.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial comparing extended-duration betrixaban with standard-duration enoxaparin
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">7,513 patients hospitalized with acute medical illnesses, reduced mobility, and additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Betrixaban for 35 to 42 days versus subcutaneous enoxaparin for 10Â±4 days
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Efficacy Outcome: Composite of asymptomatic proximal deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic venous thromboembolism, between days 1 to 42.
Primary Safety Outcome: Major bleeding up to 7 days after discontinuation of study medication.
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes: Symptomatic venous thromboembolism and composite of asymptomatic proximal DVT, symptomatic DVT, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause through day 42.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Approximately 15% of enrolled patients did not undergo adequate ultrasonography, thus could not be included in the main analyses of the efficacy outcomes.
