 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus already on statin therapy, does additional fenofibrate therapy reduce the risk of cardiovascular events?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes on simvastatin therapy, addition of fenofibrate did not reduce cardiovascular events compared to placebo. Routine use of this combination therapy is not supported for reducing cardiovascular risk in the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Type 2 diabetes patients are at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, partly due to dyslipidemia characterized by elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and small, dense LDL particles. This study tested whether the addition of fenofibrate to statin therapy in such patients would further reduce cardiovascular events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Modern guidelines do not currently support the use of combination fibrate-statin therapy over statin therapy alone for the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease, on statin therapy.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
LDL cholesterol 60-180 mg/dL, low HDL cholesterol, triglycerides <750 mg/dL without lipid therapy or <400 mg/dL with lipid therapy.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
Not provided.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
Mean age was 62 years, 31% female, 37% with history of cardiovascular event.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients on open-label simvastatin were randomly assigned to either fenofibrate or placebo on top of their statin therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main"> </span></p><p><span class="main">Primary Outcome
First occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Rates of death, secondary efficacy endpoints like revascularization and hospitalization for congestive heart failure.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Despite broad inclusion criteria and adequate power, no significant benefit was found. Selection criteria and event rates suggest possible benefit for certain subgroups with severe dyslipidemia.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, other NIH institutes, CDC, and General Clinical Research Centers, with study medications donated by various pharmaceutical companies.
