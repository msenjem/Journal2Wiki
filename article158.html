 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with mechanical heart valves, dabigatran was less effective than warfarin and was associated with a higher risk of both thromboembolic and bleeding complications.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Mechanical heart valve recipients typically require lifelong anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, to prevent thromboembolic complications. Dabigatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, has shown efficacy as an anticoagulant in atrial fibrillation patients and was evaluated for patients with mechanical heart valves in the RE-ALIGN trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not recommend dabigatran and other novel oral anticoagulants for patients with mechanical heart valves, generally favoring vitamin K antagonist therapy.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prospective, randomized, phase 2, open-label trial with blinded endpoint adjudication, comparing dabigatran to warfarin in patients with mechanical heart valves.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years who had either recent (within 7 days) or past (at least 3 months prior) aortic or mitral mechanical valve replacement.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Patients were randomized to receive dabigatran or warfarin in a 2:1 ratio. Dabigatran dose was selected based on renal function and adjusted for plasma levels, whereas warfarin dose was adjusted targeting an INR of 2 to 3 or 2.5 to 3.5.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The primary endpoint was the trough plasma level of dabigatran, with secondary endpoints including stroke, systemic embolism, valve thrombosis, and major bleeding events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was stopped early due to excess thromboembolic and bleeding events in the dabigatran group, which may have caused an underestimation of long-term efficacy and safety.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim. 
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Further Reading</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Full details of the study design and results are available in the published article by The New England Journal of Medicine and additional supplementary material. </span></p>
