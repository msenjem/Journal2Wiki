 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does targeted hypothermia improve survival and functional outcomes in adults with coma who have experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest compared with targeted normothermia?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Targeted hypothermia did not result in a lower incidence of death at 6 months compared to targeted normothermia in patients with coma after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The use of targeted temperature management is a common practice for neuroprotection in comatose patients who have been resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Previous studies have suggested benefits from hypothermia at 33°C, but recent evidence and guidelines reflect low certainty due to potential biases and small sample sizes. The Hypothermia vs. Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest trial (TTM2) aimed to provide more conclusive evidence by comparing targeted hypothermia at 33°C with targeted normothermia that included early treatment of fever.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Prior to this study, international guidelines recommended targeted temperature management for patients after cardiac arrest for neuroprotection. TTM2's findings may prompt a reevaluation of these guidelines.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Open-label, randomized, superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment
- N=1,900 adults in coma after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac or unknown cause
- Targeted hypothermia at 33°C with controlled rewarming (n=930)
- Targeted normothermia with early treatment of fever (n=931)
- Enrollment: November 2017 – January 2020
- Primary outcome: All-cause mortality at 6 months
- Secondary outcomes: Functional outcomes at 6 months using the modified Rankin scale, number of days alive and out of the hospital, survival analysis, and quality of life assessed by EQ-5D-5L
- Prespecified adverse events: Pneumonia, sepsis, bleeding, arrhythmia with hemodynamic compromise, skin complications
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion criteria: Adults ≥18 years of age with presumed cardiac or unknown cause out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, coma, and no ability to obey verbal commands post-resuscitation
- Exclusion criteria: More than 180 minutes from return of spontaneous circulation to screening, unwitnessed cardiac arrest with initial asystole, care limitations
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Hypothermia group: Immediate cooling to target temperature of 33°C, maintained until 28 hours, followed by rewarming
- Normothermia group: Temperature maintained at ≤37.5°C, with temperature management devices initiated if body temperature reached ≥37.8°C
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary: At 6 months, death occurred in 50% of patients in the hypothermia group and 48% in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.14; P=0.37).
- Modified Rankin scale scores (0-6) indicating functional outcome were similar between groups at 6 months, with 55% in both groups experiencing moderately severe disability or worse.
- Outcomes were consistent across prespecified subgroups.
- Arrhythmias resulting in hemodynamic compromise were more common in the hypothermia group compared to the normothermia group.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- The trial did not include a control group without any temperature management, leaving unanswered whether any management is superior to none.
- ICU staff were aware of temperature targets, which may have influenced care outside of the study parameters.
- The study was limited to out-of-hospital arrests due to presumed cardiac or unknown cause, so the results may not be fully generalizable to other types of cardiac arrest.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Supported by independent research grants from various nonprofit and governmental agencies, with no commercial funding.
