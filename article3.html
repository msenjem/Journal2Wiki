 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Does dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus low-dose aspirin improve outcomes in a broad population of patients at high risk for atherothrombotic events compared to aspirin alone?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In a broad population of high-risk patients, dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus low-dose aspirin did not significantly reduce the rate of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes compared to aspirin alone. There was a suggestion of harm in patients with multiple risk factors and only a marginal benefit in patients with established cardiovascular disease.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin had not been widely tested in patients at high risk for atherothrombotic events beyond those with acute coronary syndromes or undergoing angioplasty.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines do not generally recommend dual antiplatelet therapy for a broad high-risk population outside specific indications like acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
- N=15,603
- Clopidogrel (75 mg per day) plus low-dose aspirin (75-162 mg per day), n=7802
- Placebo plus low-dose aspirin (75-162 mg per day), n=7801
- Median follow-up: 28 months
- Analysis: Intention-to-treat
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Inclusion Criteria: Patients 45 years or older with clinically evident cardiovascular disease or multiple atherothrombotic risk factors
- Exclusion Criteria: Use of long-term oral antithrombotic medications or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; planned revascularization; established indications for clopidogrel therapy
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Median age: 64 years, 29.8% female
- Patients with established cardiovascular disease: over 75%
- Patients with multiple atherothrombotic risk factors: remaining percentage
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Patients were randomized to either clopidogrel plus aspirin or placebo plus aspirin.
- Standard therapy, including statins and ACE inhibitors, was administered at the discretion of the investigator.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Primary Outcome: Composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes 
  - Clopidogrel: 6.8%, Placebo: 7.3% (RR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.05; P=0.22)
- Secondary Outcomes: Composite of primary outcome or hospitalization for unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or revascularization
  - Clopidogrel: 16.7%, Placebo: 17.9% (RR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.995; P=0.04)
  - Severe bleeding: Clopidogrel: 1.7%, Placebo: 1.3% (P=0.09)
  - Moderate bleeding: Clopidogrel: 2.1%, Placebo: 1.3% (P<0.001)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Funding</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">The trial was sponsored and funded by Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Dr. Topol was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.
