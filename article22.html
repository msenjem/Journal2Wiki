 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In men with unstable angina, treatment with aspirin for 12 weeks led to a 51% reduction in the risk of death or acute myocardial infarction compared to placebo.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Unstable angina is a condition with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and death. Prior to this study, the utility of aspirin in the management of unstable angina was not well defined.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Guidelines</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Current guidelines were not influenced by this trial since it was conducted prior to the establishment of modern guideline processes.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Design</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Population</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Total number of participants: 1266 men
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Inclusion Criteria
- Men with unstable angina
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Exclusion Criteria
- Women were not included in this trial
 </span></p><p><span class="main">Baseline Characteristics
- Men with unstable angina with various baseline characteristics.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Interventions</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Aspirin 324 mg in buffered solution daily for 12 weeks (n=625)
- Placebo (n=641)
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Primary Outcomes
- Combined incidence of death or acute myocardial infarction after 12 weeks: 5.0% in the aspirin group vs. 10.1% in the placebo group (51% reduction; P = 0.0005).
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Outcomes</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">- Incidence of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction: 3.4% in the aspirin group compared to 6.9% in the placebo group (51% reduction; P = 0.005).
- Reduction in mortality: 1.6% in the aspirin group compared to 3.3% in the placebo group (51% reduction; not statistically significant; P = 0.054).
- No significant difference in gastrointestinal symptoms or blood loss between groups.
