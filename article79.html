 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Clinical Question</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">In patients with established cardiovascular disease and elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite statin therapy, does evolocumab further reduce cardiovascular events?
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Bottom Line</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Among patients with cardiovascular disease and elevated LDL cholesterol levels on statin therapy, the addition of evolocumab further reduced LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular events.
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Major Points</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">While statins have significantly reduced cardiovascular events through LDL cholesterol lowering, not all patients reach target LDL cholesterol levels with statins alone. Evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibiting PCSK9, has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol by approximately 60%. Its cardiovascular event reduction potential was unclear.
 </span></p><p><span class="main">The FOURIER trial randomized 27,564 patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) despite statin therapy to receive either evolocumab or placebo. At 48 weeks, evolocumab reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 59% compared to placebo. After a median follow-up of 2.2 years, evolocumab reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) by 15%. The treatment effect appeared to increase over time.

Outcomes
Primary Outcome
Primary composite endpoint: 9.8% in evolocumab vs. 11.3% in placebo (HR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.92; P<0.001)
Secondary Outcomes
Key secondary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI or stroke): 5.9% in evolocumab vs. 7.4% in placebo (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.88; P<0.001)
Other individual outcomes: Significant reductions for MI, stroke, and coronary revascularization
No significant effect on cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for unstable angina, overall death, or urgent revascularization
 </span></p><h2><span class="labels">Criticisms</span></h2> <hr width="88.5%", align = "right", size="2"><p><span class="main">Relatively short follow-up duration compared to other lipid-lowering trials
The majority but not all patients on high-intensity statin therapy; low ezetimibe use
